Nine years in the making, Hitler's U-boat War is destined to become the definitive account of the German submarine war against the Allies, or "The Battle of the Atlantic."<br><br>It is an epic sea story, the most arduous and prolonged naval battle in all history. For a period of nearly six years, the German U-boat force attempted to blockade and isolate the British Isles, in hopes of forcing the British out of the war, thereby thwarting the Allied strategic air assault on German cities as well as Overlord, the Allied invasion of Occupied France. Fortunately for the Allies, the U-boat force failed to achieve either of these objectives, but in the attempt they sank 2,800 Allied merchant ships, while the Allies sank nearly 800 U-boats. On both sides, tens of thousands of sailors perished.<br><br>The top secret Allied penetration of German naval codes, and, conversely, the top secret German penetration of Allied naval codes played important roles in the Atlantic naval battle. In order to safeguard the secrets of codebreaking in the postwar years, London and Washington agreed to withhold all official codebreaking and U-boat records. Thus for decade upon decade an authoritative and definitive history of the Battle of the Atlantic could not be attempted. The accounts that did appear were incomplete and full of errors of fact and false interpretations and conclusions, often leaving the entirely wrong impression that the German U-boats came within a whisker of defeating the Allies, a myth that persists.<br><br>When London and Washington finally began to release the official records in the 1980s, Clay Blair and his wife, Joan, commenced work on this history in Washington, London, and Germany. They relied on the official records as well as the work of German, British, American, and Canadian naval scholars who published studies of bits and pieces of the story. The end result is this magnificent and monumental work, crammed with vivid and dramatic scenes of naval actions and dispassionate but startling new revelations and interpretations and conclusions about all aspects of the Battle of the Atlantic. <br><br>The Blair history will be published in two volumes. This first volume, The Hunters, covers the first three years of the war, August 1939 to August 1942. Told chronologically, it is subdivided into two major sections, the War Against the British Empire, and the War Against the Americas. Volume II, The Hunted, to follow a year later, will cover the last years of the naval war in Europe, August 1942 to May 1945, when the Allies finally overcame the U-boat threat.<br><br>Never before has Hitler's U-boat war been chronicled with such authority, fidelity, objectivity, and detail. Nothing is omitted. Even those who fought the Battle of the Atlantic will find no end of surprises. Later generations will benefit by having at hand an account of this important phase of World War II, free of bias and mythology.</p><p>A former infantryman, Adolf Hitler had little use for the German navy, which he considered inept and politically suspect. Still, through the skillful maneuverings of a young, up-and-coming naval officer named Karl D�nitz, Hitler eventually endorsed a costly program of shipbuilding. As a result, D�nitz was able to field a vast fleet of U-boats when Germany went to war against France and England in 1939. Although his enemies were initially better equipped, D�nitz was the craftier fighter, launching daring raids on shipping convoys and Allied harbors, and for a time, controlling the chief Atlantic sealanes.<p> In this monumental history, Clay Blair analyzes the German U-boat campaigns from 1939 to 1942 (a companion volume continues his narrative to 1945), which, he writes, fall into three phases: one against England alone, another against the newly arrived American navy, and a furious third against the combined Allied forces. Blair argues, against other historians, that the "U-boat peril" has been overestimated. He holds that the American submarine campaign against Japan in the Pacific was far more effective, and observes that 99 percent of Allied merchant ships on transatlantic convoys reached their destinations. Even so, the U-boats introduced a powerful element of terror into an already horrific war, diverting Allied effort into antisubmarine campaigns and delaying the transport of much-needed materiel.</p><p> Blair's outstanding work adds much to the naval history of World War II. Packed with detail, it is sure to become a standard work on the Battle of the Atlantic. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Military history of a surpassingly high order, which...could become the standard reference on U-boats."<p>--Kirkus Reviews<br></p></p><h2>CITY</h2><p>Superb design, magnificent illustrations, and clearly presented information distinguish all of David Macaulay&#39;s books. Whether chronicling the monumental achievements of past civilizations or satirizing modern architecture, he is concerned above all in how constructions are made and what their effects are on people and their lives.</p><p></p><h2>Mir�</h2><p><strong>Mir�'s world of forms resembling shorthand symbols</strong> &nbsp; Joan Mir� (1893-1983) is one of the most significant Spanish painters of the twentieth century. His early work clearly shows the influence of Fauvism and Cubism. The Catalan landscape also shapes the themes and treatment of these initial works. In his travels, Mir� encountered the intellectual avant-garde of his time. His friends included Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Andr� Masson, Jean Arp and Pablo Picasso.<br> <br> From the mid-twenties onward, Mir� strove to leave direct objective references behind and developed the pictograms that typify his style. The pictures of this period, which include perhaps the most beautiful and significant ones of his whole oeuvre, dispense with spatiality and an unambiguous reference to objects. From now on, the surfaces are defined by numerals, writing, abstract emblems, and playful figures and creatures.<br> <br> Nineteen forty four saw the beginning of his extensive graphic oeuvre, ceramics, monumental mural works, and sculptures. In these works, too, the Catalan artist sought the solid foundation of a figurative, symbolic art with orientation as regards content: faces, stars, moons, rudimentary animal forms, letters. Joan Mir� developed in several stages his characteristic flowing calligraphic style and his world of forms resembling shorthand symbols. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>This title in the Modern Masters series focuses on the work of Joan Miro, one of the painters most often associated with surrealism. Miro studied art in his native Barcelona before joining the Paris art scene in the 1920s. Fantasy, dreams, and myths played an important role in Miro&#39;s early works, many of which are included in the more than 70 full-color reproductions of paintings, sculptures, and tapestries in this collection. This is a fine introduction to the monumental works of one of the foremost artists of the 20th century.Janis Mink studied art history at Smith College and gained her doctorate in Hamburg under Martin Warnke. She is presently a writer and curator.</p><h2>Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s: A Short Novel and Three Stories</h2><p>Contains:<br><br>Breakfast at Tiffany's<br>House of Flowers<br>A Diamond Guitar<br>A Christmas Memory</p><p>This is a story that was first published in 1958. This wacky hillbilly-turned-playgirl who lives in a Manhattan brownstone shares not only his philosophy of freedom and acceptance of human irregularities but also his fears and anxieties--&#39;the mean reds&#39; she calls them. For her the cure is to jump into a taxi and head for Tiffany&#39;s; nothing bad could happen, she says, amid &#39;that lovely smell of silver and alligator wallets, &#39;&#39; and her dream is to have breakfast in that soothing setting.<b>The Modern Library</b> has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

A woman who seeks a sense of personal power and an escape from pain may use sex and romance as a way to feel in control, just as an alcoholic uses alcohol; but sex never satisfies her longing for love and self-worth. In this wise and compassionate book, Charlotte Kasl shows women how they can learn to experience their sexuality as a source for love and positive power and sex as an expression that honors the soul as well as the body.</p><p><br>Charlotte D. Kasl is a social activist and a psychologist at the forefront of the empowerment movement sweeping the recovery field. She lectures and leads workshops in the United States and abroad and lives near Missoula, MT.Certain women (and men) use sex addictively as a substitute for love, nurture or power, according to Minneapolis psychologist Kasl. "Crammed with case histories, diagrams and therapeutic suggestions, this study draws on her work with members of two organizations: Sex Addicts Anonymous, and Co-Dependents of Sex Addicts, a group for partners of so-called sex addicts," wrote PW. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Water: The Book of Fantastic Literature</h2><p>Short stories by authors including Julio Cortazar, Saki, Edgar Allan Poe, and Ray Bradbury deal with hauntings, time warps, prophetic dreams, strange creatures, and bizarre occurrences</p><p></p><h2>Black&#x2019;s Law Dictionary, Pocket, 5th Edition</h2><p>Black&#x2019;s Law Dictionary, Pocket Edition is the top-selling paperback law dictionary for good reason.

Frightened, Kendra believes someone is always watching and following her, leaving menacing messages only she understands. If she lets her guard down even for a minute, it could cost Kendra her life. To relieve the pressure, Kendra cuts; aside from her brilliantly expressive artwork, it's her only way of coping. Since her own mother is too self-absorbed to hear her cries for help, Kendra finds support in others instead: from her therapist and her art teacher, from Sandy, the close family friend who encourages her artwork, and from Meghan, the classmate who's becoming a friend and maybe more. But the truth about Kendra's abuse is just waiting to explode, with startling unforeseen consequences. <i>Scars</i> is the unforgettable story of one girl's frightening path to the truth.</p><p>When I wrote SCARS, I wrote the book I needed as a teen and could never find. I drew on my abuse and trauma experience to write SCARS and bring an insider perspective; like Kendra, I'm a sexual abuse survivor, I used self-harm (and art) to cope, and I'm queer. I know how alone I felt, and how blamed--and when you're in pain, feeling alone and blamed can make the pain so much worse.<br><br> I still get reader letters every week telling me how SCARS helped readers know they're not alone; feel understood for the very first time; talk about their own self-harm, sexual abuse, or being queer; get help; stop cutting or want to stop; and a few have even told me that it helped them not want to kill themselves. I also hear from people who've never had any of those experiences before, who let me know that they understand self-harm now (and aren't so&nbsp;judgmental&nbsp;about it any more). I am grateful for all the reader letters that come in, and I try to answer them all (though it can take me a while).<br>It's my own arm on the cover of SCARS.Cheryl Rainfield writes realistic edgy fiction for teens, fantasy for children, and some nonfiction articles for adults.

Have you watched with frustration as your boy flounders with girls?<br>&nbsp;<br>Welcome to Boy World. It&#x2019;s a place where asking for help or showing emotional pain often feels impossible. Where sports and video games can mean everything, but working hard in school frequently earns ridicule from &#x201c;the guys&#x201d; even as they ask to copy assignments. Where &#x201c;masterminds&#x201d; dominate and friends ruthlessly insult each other but can never object when someone steps over the line. Where hiding problems from adults is the ironclad rule because their involvement only makes situations worse. Boy world is governed by social hierarchies and a powerful set of unwritten rules that have huge implications for your boy&#x2019;s relationships, his interactions with you, and the man he&#x2019;ll become. If you want what&#x2019;s<i> </i>best for him, you need to know what these rules are and how to work with them effectively.<br>&nbsp;<br>What you&#x2019;ll find in <i>Masterminds and Wingmen </i>is critically important for every parent &#x2013; or <i>anyone </i>who cares about boys &#x2013; to know. Collaborating with a large team of middle- and high-school-age editors, Rosalind Wiseman has created an unprecedented guide to the life your boy is <i>actually</i> experiencing &#x2013; his on-the-ground reality.&nbsp; Not only does Wiseman challenge you to examine your assumptions, she offers innovative coping strategies aimed at helping your boy develop a positive, authentic, and strong sense of self.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Rosalind Wiseman</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Why turn your attention to boys? Haven&#x2019;t they always been in an advantageous position? What has changed?</strong></p> <p>A. While in some ways it seems indisputable that boys have an advantage over girls, it depends on how you define &#x201c;advantage.&#x201d; Yes, some boys have social status and power that enables them to silence others&#x2014;boys and girls alike. Some boys can use their advantage to hurt others and not be held accountable. But I don&#x2019;t think of it as advantage per se because it&#x2019;s impossible to have meaningful connections and relationships with other people when you feel entitled to use those people. And in regards to many boys in middle and high school who&#x2019;ve barely started puberty, if you asked them who has more advantage, them or the ninth-grade girl who looks like she&#x2019;s eighteen, they&#x2019;d laugh at you. To them it seems as if girls have all the power.</p> <p><strong>Q. I know you wrote this book with boy editors from every walk of life&#x2014;were you surprised by what the guys revealed to you?</strong></p> <p>A. Yes! I knew that boys had complex emotional lives, but there was a lot I didn&#x2019;t know. For example, it&#x2019;s funny, but boys hate it when their parents pick them up from school or practice and ask a million questions. Other things I learned are more serious. I didn&#x2019;t realize how often adults dismiss boys&#x2019; feelings, or that boys regularly have experiences where people assume they&#x2019;re either hormone-crazed jerks or lazy slackers&#x2014;or both. I also didn&#x2019;t realize how complicated lying is in &#x201c;Boy World.&#x201d; Boys lie for many different reasons and our (adult) responses when we catch boys doing it need to reflect an understanding of the reason they lied in the first place. If we don&#x2019;t understand it, we can&#x2019;t impart whatever values we want to teach boys.</p> <p>It also surprised me that so many boys and young men volunteered to help me with this project. Within six months I had more than 150 boys, aged eight to twenty-four, signed on as editors. They came from all over the country and every walk of life: private East Coast boarding schools, New Orleans&#x2019;s 7th and 9th ward public schools, working-class communities in the Midwest, Southern California suburbs, and every other type of educational environment imaginable. These boys assisted me throughout the writing process to make sure the book was accurate and relevant and captured the lives they really lead.</p> <p><strong>Q. How do you think this book will help parents to assist boys in navigating the middle and high school years? </strong></p> <p>A. I am hoping it will make parents realize that behind a boy&#x2019;s silence or glib assurance that &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine&#x201d; is a person with deep emotional needs&#x2014;one who wants meaningful relationships with adults whom he can believe in. Parents can support the emotional lives of their sons without making them soft or unable to handle life&#x2019;s challenges and hardships. Giving boys the skills to be socially competent when they&#x2019;re in conflict or upset with someone is the way for them to be truly secure. The boys want and need this support. I hope this book will help move the conversation forward.</p> <p><strong>Q. What can teachers, coaches, and school administrators get from this book?</strong></p> <p>A. First and foremost, they&#x2019;ll gain an appreciation of how critical they are in helping boys to believe what honorable, courageous men they truly can be. Boys often see how hypocritical adults can be, and that disillusionment can make a boy not follow his passions. It can make him disengage from the things and people he values most. Every day, educators have the opportunity to be role models of what it looks like to be just, fair, and honorable. They also have the opportunity to be bullies, abusers of power, and cowards. I want educators to read <em>Masterminds</em> and really hear what the boys are saying about the two kinds of men that exist in their lives, and having heard it, to strive to do their best for the boys in their charge.</p><b>ROSALIND WISEMAN</b> is an educator, parenting expert, and founder of Creating Cultures of Dignity, an organization that helps young people successfully navigate the social challenges of young adulthood.

He walked upright, his pale face defiant, fearless. <br><br>The crowd jeered at him and cursed him. He seemed not to see them.&nbsp;But he saw me. Our eyes met, and in that momentary exchange of looks there&nbsp;was a lifetime. <br><br>I was responsible for his death, and he knew it. <br><br>I had been hunting him for decades.

Millions and millions of readers have flocked to the website (www.conspiracyoftherich.com) to read what Robert has to say about the recession, and the readers have posted thousands of comments. Some of those reader comments will even be included in the final tradepaper version.</p><p>Robert Kiyosaki is the bestselling author of the RICH DAD POOR DAD, which is the bestselling personal finance book of all time.In the latest installment of Kiyosaki's Rich Dad series, he opts for an innovative approach with largely diminished returns: struggling with a way to inform average citizens on the current economic crisis, and how to rise above it, Kiyosaki decided to write a book in online installments, seeking the questions and comments of his readers (which are peppered throughout this print version). Though an undeniably effective technique for help readers identify with the material, more professional input would have produced a volume buoyed by more of Kiosaki's lucid explanation, and less bogged down with repetition, poor pacing and a rigid view of government policies. Regurgitating dogma from previous books without fleshing them out, it seems Kiyosaki is less interested in creating a new volume than in teasing his old volumes. Kiyosaki's fans will doubtless buy this and may enjoy it, but readers new to the Rich Dad series will feel obligated to buy his other books for a proper understanding-something of a "conspiracy of the rich" in itself. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As they were setting up camp to launch their lion research, gunfire echoed off the cliffs nearby. Gangs of ivory poachers were not only shooting the elephants but also virtually enslaving local villagers. Against unimaginable odds, Mark and Delia stopped the poaching by helping the villagers find other work, start small businesses, and improve their health care and education.<br><br>Living with wild creatures all around (lions sleeping at their toes, an orphan elephant dancing a jig in camp), Mark and Delia observed surprising similarities between the behaviors of humans and those of other animals. The bonding among young female animals and the competition among males reminded them of their own childhoods. As the elephant population slowly recovered from poaching, the Owenses saw parallels to human societies under stress. Older elephants, killed for their tusks, had taken with them the knowledge that had been passed down to the young for generations. The slaughter of the elders led to chaos -- single mothers without older females to guide them, solitary orphans, rowdy gangs of young males -- and a scientific mystery: how could there be so many babies and so few females old enough to be mothers? A young orphan they named Gift eventually provided the clue to the remarkable discovery that revealed the elephants' secret.<br><br>After the local ivory poachers were put out of business, they shifted their sights from the elephants to the Owenses. To save themselves, Mark and Delia took a lesson from the elephants, employing one of the last secrets of the savanna.<br><br></p><p>No Bio1 Delia Gift<br><br>A gift into the world for whoever will accept it.<br> Richard Bach . . . there are conflicts of interest between male and female in courtship and mating.<br> J . R. Krebs and N. B. Davies<br><br>Between the trees of the forest, amid the thorny undergrowth, under tangles of twisted twigs is a space that is more color than place. It is a grayness painted by drooping limbs and distant branches that blur together and fade into nothingness. It is not a shadow but a pause in the landscape, rarely noticed because our eyes touch the trees, not the emptiness on either side of them. And elephants are the color of this space. As large as they are, elephants can disappear into these secret surroundings, dissolve into the background. When poachers slaughtered the elephants of North Luangwa, the few remaining survivors slipped into the understory. They were seldom seen and almost never heard because they rarely lifted their trunks to trumpet.<br> When we first came to the Luangwa Valley we could barely grab a glimpse through our binoculars of the elephants&#x2019; broad, gray bottoms and thin tails before they tore into the thick brush and disappeared. As poaching decreased, a hushed peace settled over the valley, like the silence of fog folded among hills at the end of a rain. In 1991 fewer than ten elephants were shot in North Luangwa, down from a thousand killed illegally every year for a decade. It was an unexpected yet natural quiet, as if a waterfall had frozen in midsong in an ice storm, leaving the land humming with the soft sounds of life. And then, once again, the elephants began to trumpet.<br> Slowly, beginning with Survivor, then Long Tail, Cheers, Stumpie, and Turbo the Camp Group a few of the male elephants learned that they were safe near our camp, Marula-Puku, which we had built in a large grove of marula trees on a small river, the Lubonga, halfway between the massive mountains of the escarpment and the Luangwa River. The elephants came at all times of the year, not just when the marula fruits were ripe. Sometimes they turned their giant rumps to our thatched roof and scratched their thick hides on the rough grass, closing their eyes in what appeared to be the most blissful glee. Elephants can make a lot of noise while feeding, tearing down branches or pushing over medium-size trees, or they can feed as silently as kittens, munching on fruits for long moments.<br> One night, as Cheers fed on one side of our cottage and Long Tail on the other, both only a few yards from our bed made of reeds, they let forth with full vocalizations. Mark and I, shrouded in our mosquito net, sat up as the sounds shook us. A lion&#x2019;s roar pounds the chest like deep sounds reverberating in a barrel; an elephant&#x2019;s trumpet, especially after decades of being stifled, stills the heart.<br> In the years before they learned to trust us, they must have watched from the hillsides, remembering the fruits of the marula grove yet afraid to come near. But once they made up their minds that we were harmless, nothing we did seemed to bother them. No matter whether Mark flew the helicopter low over the treetops, or our trucks rumbled in and out, or we cooked popcorn on the open fire, the elephants came to camp. When we stepped out of our cottages, we had to remember to look carefully both ways, or we might walk into an elephant&#x2019;s knee.<br> That nearly happened one dark evening when Mark walked quickly out of our open, thatched dining n&#x2019;saka, or gazebo, where we were eating a dinner of spicy beans by candlelight. He was headed toward our bedroom cottage to retrieve the mosquito repellent and, having his mind on other things, played his flashlight beam along the ground looking for snakes. He heard a loud wooosh and felt a rush of wind. Looking up, he saw an elephant&#x2019;s chin and trunk swishing wildly about against the stars. Cheers stumbled out of Mark&#x2019;s path, twisting and turning to avoid the small primate. Both man and elephant backpedaled twenty yards and stood gazing at each other. Cheers finally settled down. He lifted his trunk one last time, flicking dust in the flashlight beam, and ambled to the office cottage, where he fed on marula fruits, making loud slurping sounds.<br> The elephants were not always so amiable. On a soft afternoon when the sun was shining through a mist of rain, I was reading in the n&#x2019;saka by the river. Cheers marched briskly and silently into camp and fed on fallen marula fruits next to the bedroom cottage some thirty yards away. For a while he and I, alone in camp, went about our work, only glancing at the other now and then. The occasional heavy drop of rain fell from the trees as the mist cleared, and a faint wisp of steam rose from Cheers&#x2019;s broad, warm back. Thee picture was too beautiful to keep only as a memory, so I decided to photograph him. To get a better view, I tiptoed out and stood under a fruittttt tree not, as it turned out, a good place to stand in marula season. Suddenly Cheers turned and walked directly toward my tree. Within seconds he was only fifteen yards away. Surely he had seen me, but he came on purposefully, his massive body swaying, as though I weren&#x2019;t there. I was unsure whether to stand or run, but Cheers was not the least bit indecisive; this was his tree, his fruit. Flapping his ears wildly, he mock-charged me. I ran backward about ten yards, turned, and jumped off the steep bank into the river, where Ripples the crocodile lived.<br> Even as the poaching decreased, the small female groups the remnants of those once large family units were shyer than the males. Finally, after several years, one or two females with their young calves would feed on the tall grass across the river, not far from Long Tail or Survivor. But they never ventured into camp, just wandered nearby and stared at us from the bluff above our cottages. Their backs glistening with mud, the youngsters would splash in and out of the river and romp on the beach across from the n&#x2019;saka.<br><br>To keep out the African sun, we built our camp cottages with stone walls fourteen inches thick and roofed them with thatch about two feet deep. The huts stayed cave-cool even when the dry-season heat exceeded one hundred degrees. One afternoon, as I sat in the dim office cottage analyzing elephant footprint data on the solar-powered computer, a soft knock sounded on the door, and I looked up to see Patrick Mwamba, one of the first four Bemba tribesmen we had hired, years before, at the door. When he first came to us asking for work, the only tool he knew was his faithful ax; now he was our head mechanic and grader operator. Patrick is shy and gentle, with a fawnlike face.<br> Dr. Delia, come see,&#x201d; he said. There is a baby elephant. She is coming to us by the river.&#x201d; I switched off the computer to save solar power and rushed to the doorway, where Patrick pointed to a small elephant trotting along the river&#x2019;s edge toward camp. Her tiny trunk jiggled about as she rambled along the sand. Suddenly she changed directions, galloped into the long grass, and reappeared upstream jogging in yet another direction, looking wildly around. Finally she halted and lifted her trunk, turning the end around like a periscope.<br> Patrick, have you seen her mother any other elephants?&#x201d; No, madame, she is very much alone in this place.&#x201d; An orphan. The park was sprinkled with these tiny survivors, youngsters who had watched every adult in their family mowed down by poachers. From the air we had seen infants standing by their fallen mothers or wandering around in aimless search for their families. Some died right there, waiting for their mothers to rise again. Some never found the herd. By the time we arrived at the site, the young elephants were usually gone or dead. Now one youngster had stumbled onto the shore opposite our camp and stood still, trunk hanging low, looking away as if we did not exist.<br> I could see Harrison Simbeye and Jackson Kasokola, our other assistants, and Mark watching the small elephant from behind the marula trees at the workshop. She wandered around the beach again for a few more minutes, then disappeared into the thick acacia brush. Without speaking and alert for crocodiles, the men and I forded the shallow river. We stood in a long line staring at the lonely prints in the sand.<br> Elephants grow throughout their lives, so their age can be determined by measuring the length of their hind footprints. The size of the prints suggested that this elephant was five years old. We named her Gift, after the recently deceased daughter of Tom Kotela, one of the Zambian game scout leaders. But we doubted if we would ever see her again.<br> There are two species of elephants in Africa. One, Loxodonta cyclotis, is the forest elephant found in Congo. Most of the others, including those of the Luangwa Valley, are Loxodonta africana, the savanna elephant.<br> Normally, when there is little or no poaching, female elephants live in family units whose matriarchal gene lines persist for generations. As is the case with many other social mammals, a female remains in her birth group all her life, so the group is made up of grandmothers, mothers, aunts, and sisters who feed, play, and raise their young together until they die. Males born into the group remain with the family only until their hormones send them off in search of unrelated females with whom to mate. Then they wander on their own or with a loose alliance of cronies, taking risks, fighting, or showing off to attract as many females as possible. So there are no adult males permanently attached to the family unit.<br> Female elephants touch often, rub backs and shoulders, gently tangling trunks. From their mothers and older relatives, the youngsters learn which plants to eat, where the waterholes are, and how to avoid predators. When an infant squeals, any of the female group members will run to the rescue. An elephant family is a fortress of females.<br> But little Gift was alone. She was old enough to be weaned, yet how could she survive without her family unit? Elephants rarely adopt orphans, and never nonrelatives.<br> The next day we spotted Long Tail and Cheers across the river, tearing up long grass and shoving it into their mouths with their trunks. Gift was forty yards away, feeding on shorter, tenderer grasses. From then on, whenever Long Tail, Cheers, or the other males wandered into camp, little Gift bounced along behind them. She looked minute next to them, a windup toy circling on her own in the background. In the absence of her family unit, and abandoning all normal elephant behavior, Gift had taken up residency near the Camp Group males.<br> For the most part, the males ignored her. At five, she was much too young to breed and, as is true of most male mammals, they had no other use for her. Before poaching was rampant in the Luangwa Valley, female elephants usually ovulated for the first time at fourteen years of age and delivered their first calf at sixteen. So, as the males roamed around in their habitual feeding patterns, first on the hillsides, then across the river in the long grass, the diminutive Gift stayed within sight of them but fed on her own. Sometimes she stepped gingerly up to one of the towering males and reached out her tiny trunk in greeting. Her mother, sisters, and aunts would have snaked their trunks out to hers and twisted them together. Her female family would have circled her, bumped heads, rubbed backs like affectionate tanks. Gift would have observed older mothers suckling their young and played with other infants, all the while learning the elephant alphabet. But the Camp Group males turned away from her, their huge backsides blocking her only chance at companionship. A cold shoulder from an elephant is a big rejection.<br> It would be an exaggeration to call any female elephant dainty. With their tree-trunk legs, thick ankles, and heavy shoulders not to mention their less than elegant profiles it&#x2019;s difficult to describe them as at all feminine. However, Gift came close to being ladylike, at least for an elephant. Perhaps it was just that compared to the males, she seemed so much more delicate in her feeding and lighter of foot. She had other little habits that reminded me of a young girl who had somehow found herself in a male world. One afternoon while feeding on a small tree, she broke off a branch covered with fresh, green leaves. Instead of eating the forage, she wandered around rather aimlessly for over thirty minutes carrying the branch in her trunk, as a girl might carry wildflowers in a spring meadow.<br> With no group, Gift had no playmates. More than a pastime, play with peers and elders is essential for forming lifelong bonds, perfecting trunk- eye coordination, and testing dominance. Gift had to play alone. Once she stepped into the flooded river and submerged herself completely. Rolling over and over, she splashed about, with a leg poking up here, her trunk there. Now and then she would burst out of the water like a breaching whale and dive underneath again.<br> Gift&#x2019;s special trademark was her jig. We often blundered into her when we rushed around camp. In a hurry to get to the plane for an elephant survey or to the office for binoculars or notebook, we would stride around a tree and come face to face with her. But she never charged us. If we got too close for her liking, she would trot away about five steps, stop, lift her tail slowly to the side, throw her head around dramatically, make a one-eighty turn, and trot back toward us. She would repeat this several times, as if dancing a jig. She also performed her dance for the massive buffaloes who fed in our camp and sometimes got in her way. Gift was never a pet; we never fed her and certainly did not touch her. But she must have felt safe around us, because she lived nearby as though she had set up her own camp near ours. She sometimes stood near our cottages watching the small female families across the river, as the youngsters frolicked and the adults greeted one another with tangled trunks. We hoped that she would join them, that against all elephant tradition they would adopt her. But she never ventured near them. As she grew older, Gift wandered farther from camp during her feeding forays, and sometimes we would not see her for weeks, and then even for months. We always worried that she had been shot, and then she would show up at our camp again.<br> Whenever we flew over the valley, observing the elephant families from the air, taking notes on every detail of the groups, counting to see if their numbers were increasing, I always searched for Gift. I longed to see a little elephant among the others, one who would perhaps look up at us and dance her jig.<br> Copyright � 2006 by Mark Owens and Delia Owens.

Mr. Ford lives with his wife and daughter in Brooklyn, New York.Ruby Bridges was the sole African American child to attend a New Orleans elementary school after court-ordered desegregation in 1960. Noted research psychiatrist Coles tells how federal marshals escorted the intrepid six-year-old past angry crowds of white protestors thronging the school. Parents of the white students kept them home, and so Ruby "began learning how to read and write in an empty classroom, an empty building." Although there are disappointingly few words from Ruby herself, Coles's use of quotes from her teacher adds to the story's poignancy ("Sometimes I'd look at her and wonder how she did it.... How she went by those mobs and sat here all by herself and yet seemed so relaxed and comfortable"). The story has a rather abrupt ending; the concluding page reprints the prayer that Ruby said daily, asking God to forgive the protesters. Coles cursorily finishes the tale of Ruby's unsettling year in an afterword (two boys and then the rest of the students returned to school; the mobs dispersed by the time Ruby entered second grade). Ford (Bright Eyes, Brown Skin; Paul Robeson) contributes affecting watercolors that play up Ruby's moral courage.

Coming face to face with an important illuminated manuscript in the original is like meeting a very famous person. We may all pretend that a well-known celebrity is no different from anyone else, and yet there is an undeniable thrill in actually meeting and talking to a person of world stature. The idea for the book, which is entirely new, is to invite the reader into intimate conversations with twelve of the most famous manuscripts in existence and to explore with the author what they tell us about nearly a thousand years of medieval history - and sometimes about the modern world too. Christopher de Hamel introduces us to kings, queens, saints, scribes, artists, librarians, thieves, dealers, collectors and the international community of manuscript scholars, showing us how he and his fellows piece together evidence to reach unexpected conclusions. He traces the elaborate journeys which these exceptionally precious artefacts have made through time and space, shows us how they have been copied, who has owned them or lusted after them (and how we can tell), how they have been embroiled in politics and scholarly disputes, how they have been regarded as objects of supreme beauty and luxury and as symbols of national identity. The book touches on religion, art, literature, music, science and the history of taste. Part travel book, part detective story, part conversation with the reader, Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts conveys the fascination and excitement of encountering some of the greatest works of art in our culture which, in the originals, are to most people completely inaccessible. At the end, we have a slightly different perspective on history and how we come by knowledge. It is a most unusual book.</p><p>In the course of a long career at Sotheby&#39;s Christopher de Hamel has probably handled and catalogued more illuminated manuscripts and over a wider range than any person alive. Since 2000, he has been Fellow and Librarian of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. The Parker Library, in his care, includes many of the earliest manuscripts in English language and history. He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Historical Society.An extraordinary book, a work of scholarship and history salted with the author&#39;s excitement as he conducts us among the great libraries of Western civilization.

What if its secret nature affected every aspect of our lives and relationships so quietly and insidiously that most of us never made the connection between the sin and its tormenting symptoms?<br><br>Bestselling author Bruce Wilkinson believes that unforgiveness is that sin. Through dynamic stories of worldwide personal ministry and solid biblical teaching, Wilkinson awakens readers to recognize and respond to their own secret wounds and the devastating unforgiveness that they can produce.

Unforgiveness is carrying around a backpack of varying weights of painful hurts and brokenness that attracts more weights of pain, making life harder and heavier.

In this updated edition, Ezzo and Bucknam present a comprehensive method to encourage a full night's sleep for the seven- to nine-week-old baby. It's easy to read, easy to follow, supported by research and by testimonials from parents and pediatricians, and includes suggestions for making the process fit into the reader's lifestyle. The authors believe a consistent sleep routine leads to happier, more responsible, and better-adjusted children. But a full night's sleep is just the short-term goal. The long-term goal is training parents to bring order and stability to their families through nurturing the marriage, providing a loving structure for one's children, and allowing flexibility in the process. <p> Twelve chapters cover feeding philosophies, monitoring baby's growth, establishing baby's routine, handling multiple births, and the ever-controversial chapter on when baby cries. The 52-week method involves four phases, beginning with "Stabilization" from birth to week 8. During weeks 9 through 15 ("Extended Night"), babies learn to sleep through the night. Ezzo and Bucknam attempt to teach the difference between a baby's many cries and advise parents on various responses to these cries. Critics dislike Ezzo's strong belief that "child-centered parenting" (feeding baby whenever it cries, sleeping with and "wearing" baby) fosters demanding, insecure toddlers. But for parents who are tired of being tired--or whose previous experience with child-centered parenting supports Ezzo's theory--it may be worth a read. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>In becoming one of America's leading infant management guides,&nbsp;<i>On Becoming&nbsp;Babywise</i>&nbsp;has continued to improve its methods and practices throughout its 25 years and this latest version is the result of all the best over the last two decades.<i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Becoming&nbsp;Babywise</i>&nbsp;continues to gain global recognition for its common-sense approach to parenting a newborn. The infant management plan offered by Pediatrician Robert Bucknam, M.D. and co-author Gary Ezzo, M.D. in this book helps parents successfully and naturally synchronize their&nbsp;baby's feeding time, waketime and nighttime cycles. The results? Happy, healthy and contented&nbsp;babies&nbsp;who sleep through the night on average between seven and nine weeks of age.&nbsp;<br> The best evaluation of any parenting philosophy, including&nbsp;Babywise, is not found in the reasoning or the logic of the hypothesis.

Rather, our larger objective is to help prepare minds for the incredible task of raising a child.&nbsp; We believe the preparation of the mind is far more important than the preparation of the nursery.&nbsp; Both can be a lot of fun.&nbsp; Your&nbsp;baby&nbsp;will not care if his head rests on designer sheets or beside Disney characters, nor is your success tied to his wardrobe or bedroom accessories, but rather to the beliefs and convictions that will eventually shape your parenting experience.&nbsp; It is our opinion that the achievements of healthy growth, contented&nbsp;babies, good naps, and playful wake times, as well as the gift of nighttime sleep, are too valuable to be left to chance.&nbsp; They need to be parent-directed and parent-managed.&nbsp; These are attainable conclusions, because infants are born with the&nbsp;capacity&nbsp;to achieve these outcomes and, equally important, the&nbsp;need&nbsp;to achieve them. &nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our goal is to demonstrate&nbsp;how&nbsp;this is done, but only after we explain&nbsp;why&nbsp;it should be done.&nbsp; We realize there are a number of parenting theories being marketed today, most of which come gift-wrapped with unrealistic promises and unnecessary burdens. In light of the many options, how can new parents know what approach is best of their families? Since every philosophy of parenting has a corresponding outcome unique to that philosophy, we encourage new and expectant parents to consider, evaluate, and decide which approach is best for their families.&nbsp; This can be accomplished by observing the end results.&nbsp; Spend time with relatives and friends who follow the Attachment Parenting style of infant care.&nbsp; Observe who practices hyper-scheduling, and certainly evaluate the outcomes associated with&nbsp;<i>On Becoming&nbsp;Babywise.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;In which homes do you observe order, peace, and tranquility?&nbsp; Don't take any marketing plug or some strangers word for truth.&nbsp; Search for yourself.&nbsp; Consider the marriages as well as the children.&nbsp; Is mom in a perpetual state of exhaustion?&nbsp; Is she nursing every two hours or less?&nbsp; Is Dad sleeping on the couch?&nbsp; What is the family life like when a child is 6, 12, and 18 months old?&nbsp; Is Mom stressed, frustrated, or lacking confidence?&nbsp; Is the&nbsp;baby&nbsp;stressed, exhausted or insecure?&nbsp; When the&nbsp;baby&nbsp;is nine months old, can the parents leave the room without the&nbsp;baby&nbsp;falling apart emotionally?&nbsp; We believe the best evaluation of any parenting philosophy, including the one found in&nbsp;<i>On Becoming&nbsp;Babywise</i>,&nbsp;is not found in the reasoning or the logic of the hypothesis but in the end results.&nbsp; Let your eyes confirm what works and what does not. You will be most confident in your parenting when you see the desired results lived out in other families using the same approach.&nbsp; Look at the&nbsp;fruit&nbsp;and then trace it back to its&nbsp;seed&nbsp;source. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The principles contained within the pages can help parents develop workable strategies that meet the needs of their&nbsp;babies&nbsp;and the rest of the family.&nbsp; These have worked for millions of parents, and when faithfully applied can work wonderfully for you!&nbsp; However, your pediatrician or family practitioner should always be consulted when questions arise about the health and welfare of your&nbsp;baby.&nbsp; Enjoy the journey of parenting!</p><h2>Balthus: Cats and Girls</h2><p><b>An insightful new look at Balthus&#x2019;s ongoing fascination with cats and girls, including his controversial paintings of young adolescents</b><br><br> Balthus&#x2019;s lifelong curiosity with the ambiguities and dark side of childhood resulted in his best-known and most iconic works.

She addresses the crucial influence of such key figures as poet Rainer Maria Rilke, his mother&#x2019;s lover, who acted as Balthus&#x2019;s surrogate father, but also includes the previously unknown voices of the girl models: their recollections and comments provide a unique perspective on some of the best known and most controversial paintings of the 20th century.</p><br><br></p><p><p> <b>Sabine Rewald<b> </b></b>is Jacques and Natasha Gelman Curator, department of Modern and Contemporary Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>"[Sabine Rewald] is by far the greatest Balthus scholar ever . . ."&#x2014;Jerry Saltz,<i> New York Magazine</i><br>"The catalogue of <i>Balthus: Cats and Girls&nbsp;</i>is a beautiful piece of work, admirably levelheaded in its treatment of his involvement with his young models."&#x2014;Jed Perl,&nbsp;<i>The New Republic</i><br></p><h2>The Mask of Sanity (Mosby medical library)</h2><p>The acclaimed study of the Psychopathic Personality</p><p></p><h2>Something Fresh: A Blandings Story</h2><p>The one thing that could be expected to militate against the peace of life at Blandings is the constant incursion of imposters.

Still, Bryson&#39;s lively take is a welcome recess from packaged, staid guides. The author of A Walk in the Woods draws readers in campfire-style, relating wacky anecdotes and random facts gathered on multiple trips down under, all the while lightening the statistics with infusions of whimsical humor. Arranged loosely by region, the book bounces between Canberra and Melbourne, the Outback and the Gold Coast, showing Bryson alone and with partners in tow. His unrelenting insistence that Australia is the most dangerous place on earth (&#34;If you are not stung or pronged to death in some unexpected manner, you may be fatally chomped by sharks or crocodiles, or carried helplessly out to sea by irresistible currents, or left to stagger to an unhappy death in the baking outback&#34;) spins off dozens of tales involving jellyfish, spiders and the world&#39;s 10 most poisonous snakes.

This, the first of three volumes of her journals and notebooks, presents a constantly and utterly surprising record of a great mind in incubation.

The authors, both assistant Special Prosecutors who guided the Watergate investigation, first under Cox then under Jaworski, reveal the working of the men whose persistence and idealism ultimately forced the resignation of the 37th President of the United States. Acting in the name of the government, yet totally independent, the Special Prosecutor and his staff literally worked around the clock to piece together the truth--in spite of a repeatedly hostile and uncooperative White House.

And for more than 200 years artists have been struggling to mix colors on this basis.<br><br> This book has changed the way that artists and all who use color think about color mixing. Translated into many languages it offers, for the first time, a way of thinking and working which replaces all that has gone before it. With sales of over 400,000 copies worldwide it has become the standard reference book on this subject.<br><br> By unravelling the many ambiguities and myths inherent in the established way of working, Michael Wilcox has transformed color mixing from a haphazard affair into a thinking process.<br><br> The sequel to the original Blue and Yellow Don't Make Green this updated and fully revised edition is packed with newly researched information. An extra 80 pages, new layout, new information on the transparency and make up of colors, and many new color swatches make this the ultimate guide to all who use and mix color.</p><p>Michael Wilcox has a widely varied background, including periods as a professional artist, a conservator of art works and an engineer. His research in art and design led to the book Blue &amp; Yellow Don't Make Green followed by The Wilcox Guide to the Best Watercolor Paints, both of which led to many changes in the pigments used in artist grade paints. Wilcox also published The Artist's Guide to Selecting Colors, which shows how to select a suitable palette in all mediums--watercolors, oil paints, acrylics and more. He lives and continues his research and writing in Bristol, England.</p><h2>Woven Shibori (The Weaver&#39;s Studio series)</h2><p><p>Covering history and method, this introduction to the breakthrough technique of woven shibori embraces new approaches to the art of weaving and dyeing. With this guide, weavers of all skill levels, using any type of loom, can explore woven shibori. Unlike traditional shibori, which uses stitches placed by needle on commercial cloth in the dyeing process, the "stitches" used in this new process are woven directly into the cloth, thus becoming part of the cloth's construction. After sections on the history of shibori and its many cultural variants, the chapters move on to thorough instructions in a range of weaving applications, from plain twills to laces. Examples, tips, and safety guides for the dyeing process are included, opening up a world of creative possibilities for weavers, textile, and fiber artists.</p></p><p><b>Catharine Ellis</b> is an artist and teacher who divides her time between studio work and the professional craft program at Haywood Community College, where she has been the fiber instructor since 1978.

And yet no one is ever likely to forget the Cuban Missile crisis of October 1962, when the world stood on the brink of full-scale nuclear war as the Soviet Union and America locked horns off the coast of Florida. The Soviet navy set sail for Cuba loaded with nuclear warheads for their newly constructed missile bases, precipitating the crisis. After 10 days of high tension, the Soviet Union backed down and the warheads were sent back home. War was averted, but up until now, no one has ever been too certain just how close the world came to catastrophe. Kennedy was assassinated long before he could write his memoirs, Castro's lips are sealed, and the Soviet archives were a closed book.<p> Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali have taken advantage of recent unrestricted access to Soviet records and performed painstaking detective work to fill the gaps in the historical record. Some of the tension of the narrative is lost, because we know the outcome; even so, they give penetrating insights as they reconstruct the drama step by step. We learn that the Kremlin did seriously consider launching a nuclear attack on the U.S.: the appropriate orders were discussed and Khrushchev spent the night of October 22 in his office so he could be on hand to cable his authorization. Some of the most interesting facts to emerge, however, are those concerning John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert. JFK had always previously been portrayed as something of a parochial gung-ho type, but this, it emerges, was merely a public persona designed to appease the Pentagon hawks. At the same time JFK was talking about a Cuban invasion, he and his brother were engaging in a more secret policy of appeasement through the Soviet ambassador. Fortunately for all of us, diplomacy won the day. In recent years, JFK has been somewhat discredited as a leader for his unpleasant sexual carryings-on and corruption. It may just be that this view is as incomplete as his portrayal as the saintly "King of Camelot". If so, <i>One Hell of a Gamble</i> could be the first stage in his partial rehabilitation. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Aleksandr Fursenko, one of Russia&#x2019;s leading historians, is a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p><h2>The Lee-Enfield: A Century of Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield Rifled and Carbines by Ian D.

Taking the Iroquois Saint Catherine Tekakwitha (1656-80) as a point of departure, Vollmann launches himself into a turbulent mytho-historico-geographical ``Stream of Time''--which in this case swirls and eddies first around the adventures of Samuel de Champlain, his comings and goings in New France, and his indefatigable efforts to map the unfamiliar territory for his own edification as much as for posterity. Always suspicious of the ``savages,'' meticulous in protecting the property of those chartered to reap the beaver harvest and other riches of the region while eager to gain his share, courageous and feared to the end, Champlain emerges as a man frequently at odds with circumstance but oddly worthy of his legendary status. The man of action gives way to men of the cloth in the latter half, as the Jesuits outmaneuver all opposition on a zealous mission of God to convert the Huron Nation or die trying. Advancing beyond the tentative fringes of French settlement along the St. Lawrence River, they seem to be the black-gowned harbingers of death when one plague after another decimates Huron villages. Happy to baptize the dead and the dying, they are resisted by shamans who have no power to halt either them or their diseases, but the ferocious Iroquois, traditional Huron enemies, are on hand to deliver the coup de grace. Jesuit martyrs are among the victims as the Huron cease to exist as a people but- -like Vollmann's restless dream-vision of North America--they are unstoppable. Vast and vivid as Canada itself, mingling the cold, deep waters of history with the present, and quixotic and ironic to its core. An immensely rewarding saga. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But few are actually bearing fruit. Kevin Harney diagnoses this problem and offers guidance for multiplying the outreach impact of churches.Organic Outreach for Churches provides direction for local congregations to weave evangelism into the fabric of the church. Commitment to the Great Commission is not simply about sending money and prayers to missions or holding occasional events to reach out (although these things are good). Organic outreach happens when evangelistic vision and action become the domain of every ministry and the commitment of every person in the congregation.This will not happen accidentally. There is huge spiritual and practical resistance to such changes. But the only way evangelism will become an organic part of a church is when every leader and each member is gripped by a commitment to proclaiming the gospel. This book is a roadmap for pastors and leaders who wish to infuse evangelistic passion into every aspect of their church&#x2019;s life.</p><p><p>Kevin G.

Portraying a young man's first sea-voyage to the East in Youth, an unenlightened maturity in <i>Heart of Darkness</i><b>,</b> and the blind old age of Captain Whalley in <i>The End of the Tether,</i> the stories in this volume are united in their theme - the <i>'Ages of Man'</i> - and in their scepticism. Conrad's vision has influenced twentieth-century writers and artists from T. S. Eliot to Jorge Luis Borges and Werner Herzog, and continues to draw critical fire. In his stimulating introduction John Lyon discusses the links between these three stories, the critiques of Chinua Achebe and Edward Said, and the ebb and flow of Conrad's magnificent narrative art.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Having known bitter poverty in his rural China home, ballet would be his family's best chance for a better future. From one hardship to another, Cunxin demonstrated perseverance and an appetite for success that led him to be chosen as one of the first two people to leave Mao's China and go to American to dance on a special cultural exchange. But life in the U.S. was nothing like his communist indoctrination had led him to believe. Ultimately, he defected to the west in a dramatic media storm, and went on to dance with the Houston Ballet for sixteen years. </p><p>This inspiring story of passion, resilience, and a family's love captures the harsh reality of life in Mao's communist China and the exciting world of professional dance. This compelling memoir includes photos documenting Li's extraordinary life.</p></p><p><p>Li Cunxin has displayed the ultimate in perseverance and determination throughout his life&#x2015;from excelling in the grueling ballet training demanded by the Beijing Dance Academy to his 16 years as one of the premier dancers from the Houston Ballet to his latest career as a stockbroker and motivational speaker.

Evoking a vivid sense of life&#x2019;s evolution in communist China and the stark contrast of Western society, he also crosses chasms of the heart. And while <i>Mao&#x2019;s Last Dancer</i> is not a self-improvement book, Li&#x2019;s courage and perseverance ultimately make his story more inspiring than a dozen tomes by the likes of Dr. Phil.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x2014;Houston Chronicle</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&#x201c;His story will appeal to an audience beyond Sinophiles and ballet aficionados.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&#x201c;He is an expert storyteller, and his memoir&#x2014;which includes his struggles to perfect his art in the tense political framework, the complex events surrounding his defection, and the heart-breaks and joys of his professional and personal lives&#x2014;makes for fascinating reading. The portions dealing with his childhood and loving family in Qingdao are especially poignant, and the work as a whole unfolds with honesty, humor, and a quiet dignity. This book has wide appeal, for it concerns not only a dancer&#x2019;s coming-of-age in a turbulent time but also individual strength, self-discovery, and the triumph of the human spirit.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x2014;Library Journal</i></p><p><b>THE BERKLEY PUBLISHING GROUP</b> <br><b>Published by the Penguin Group</b> <br><b>Penguin Group (USA) Inc.</b> <br><b>375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, USA</b> <br>Penguin Group (Canada), 90 Eglinton Avenue East, Suite 700, Toronto, Ontario M4P 2Y3, Canada <br>(a division of Pearson Penguin Canada Inc.) <br>Penguin Books Ltd., 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England <br>Penguin Group Ireland, 25 St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green, Dublin 2, Ireland (a division of Penguin Books Ltd.) <br>Penguin Group (Australia), 250 Camberwell Road, Camberwell, Victoria 3124, Australia <br>(a division of Pearson Australia Group Pty.

It is autumn, a beautiful October morning. The country air is cool but fresh.</p><p>The young girl hears happy music approaching her house. She is only eighteen, and she is nervous, frightened. She knows that many marriage introducers simply take money and tell lies. Some women from her village marry men who don&#x2019;t have all their functional body parts. Those women have to spend the rest of their lives looking after their husbands. Wife beating is common. Divorce is out of the question. Divorced women are humiliated, despised, suffering worse than an animal&#x2019;s fate. She knows some women hang themselves instead, and she prays this is not going to be her fate.</p><p>She prays to a kind and merciful god that her future husband will have two legs, two arms, two eyes and two ears. She prays that his body parts are normal and functional. She worries that he will not be kindhearted and will not like her. But most of all she worries about her unbound feet. Bound feet are still in fashion. Little girls as young as five or six have to tuck four toes under the big toe and squeeze them hard to stop the growth. It is extremely painful, and the girls have to change the cloth bandages and wash their feet daily to avoid infection. The tighter the feet are bound the smaller the feet will become. Eventually all five toes grow together. Infections often occur, and the girls are so crippled they have to walk mostly on their heels. But when this bride was about eight and her mother tried to bind her feet, two or three years later than was usual, she defied her and ran away. Her mother eventually gave up, but secretly she was pleased. A daughter with unbound feet could help do the hard chores. But would her future husband and in-laws think the same?</p><p>The groom is a young man of twenty-one. He leaves home before sunrise. Sixteen strong men are hired to carry two sedan chairs for the three-hour journey from his village to the bride&#x2019;s. There are trumpets, cymbals, gongs and bamboo flutes, and the bride&#x2019;s sedan chair is covered with red and pink silk banners and flowers. The groom&#x2019;s is a simple blue sedan chair, which will leave from the east side of the village and reenter from the west.</p><p>As soon as the groom&#x2019;s entourage leaves home, the women of his family start to prepare the house and the wedding feast to follow. They glue colored-paper cuttings all over the walls, doors and windows&#x2014;different shapes, with lucky words on them, to symbolize happiness and good fortune. They place a square table in the center of their courtyard and cover it with a red cloth. In the center they place nine huge bread rolls, called mantos, in the shape of a pagoda. There is also a metal bowl, with candlesticks and incense holders on either side. On the ground are two round bamboo mats.</p><p>The bride is in such a panicked state by the time her groom arrives. He wears a dark blue cotton mandarin gown and a big tall hat, with silk flowers pinned over his heart. He kneels, and kowtows three times, bowing his head all the way down to the floor, always facing north, always in the direction of the god of happiness.</p><p>Tea, sweets, roasted sunflower seeds and peanuts are then served. A lunch feast follows, but the cost of the meal will break the bride&#x2019;s family finances. Many relatives and friends chip in to help, but the favors and debts will have to be repaid in years to come. The groom&#x2019;s entourage has to be satisfied, however. The meal will affect her new family&#x2019;s attitude toward her. It will determine whether she will have a smooth or bumpy ride on the way to her in-laws&#x2019; house. The young bride remembers that a friend of her mother&#x2019;s was married a year before&#x2014;at her wedding, the musicians played funeral music and the carriers walked her around in circles, making her dizzy and sick. Even worse, the carriers lowered her sedan chair to the ground, which is very unlucky: that bride would end up with a life of hard work instead of a life of luxury. All this was caused by the in-laws&#x2019; dissatisfaction with the food that was served at her house.</p><p>While the groom&#x2019;s people drink their wine and eat their food, the bride sits on her bed, her kang, away from everyone, with her silk veil concealing her face. This is called the &#x201c;quiet sitting.&#x201d; She wears a long dark maroon gown, with pink silk flowers sewn onto it. Her hairpiece is full of beautiful colored hairpins and flowers, and is very heavy. She has no jewelery because her family is too poor.</p><p>Soon, her second brother secretly whispers to her through a crack in the door, &#x201c;My brother-in-law has all his moving parts!&#x201d; This is news from heaven. The young bride sobs with joy.</p><p>Toward the end of the meal, the bride&#x2019;s mother brings her a bowl of rice, a double-sided mirror and ten pairs of red chopsticks. The bride has to eat three mouthfuls of rice, and the last mouthful she spits into her mother&#x2019;s pocket. She has to keep some rice in her mouth to last all the way to her in-laws&#x2019; house before she can swallow, symbolizing that she will never starve along the entire journey of her life. Then she puts eight pairs of chopsticks into her mother&#x2019;s pocket. The remaining two pairs she keeps, the ones with chestnuts and dates tied on them, symbolizing the early arrival of sons.</p><p>The bride cannot stop shaking. Tears stream from her eyes as she spits the rice into the pocket. Soon she will become someone&#x2019;s wife and another family&#x2019;s daughter-in-law. She grabs her mother&#x2019;s hand, as if clutching onto a life-saving straw.</p><p>&#x201c;You silly girl,&#x201d; her mother says to her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t cry! You&#x2019;re going to a family with enough food. Do you want to be poor for the rest of your life?&#x201d; She takes out her handkerchief and gently wipes her daughter&#x2019;s tears and hugs her long and tight for the last time. &#x201c;My girl, I&#x2019;ll always miss you and love you. Take good care of your husband and he&#x2019;ll take good care of you. Obey him and make him happy. Bear many of his sons. Look after your mother-in-law like you&#x2019;ve looked after me. Be kind to her until she dies.&#x201d; She lowers the veil over her daughter&#x2019;s face, and leaves, feeling nothing but pain.</p><p>The bride sobs quietly for the first half of her journey to the groom&#x2019;s village. She has never left home before. She is terrified. At the halfway point one of the carriers shouts, &#x201c;Halfway point, flip your mirror!&#x201d; So she takes the mirror she&#x2019;s been given and flips it over: now she should forget her past and look forward to the future. Then she is met by a group of four carriers from the groom&#x2019;s village, to make the changeover. She doesn&#x2019;t touch the ground. The musicians continue their happy wedding tunes, and the carriers walk carefully along the uneven dirt road.</p><p>When she arrives at the groom&#x2019;s gate, the metal bowl on the table is already flaming with fire. The candle and incense are lit. The groom gets out of his sedan chair and waits for his bride, her face still concealed by her thick silk veil as she is assisted out of her sedan chair by two of his sisters. They walk together toward the table while a local wise man reads loudly an ancient poem. Few people understand it because few of them have ever gone to school, but the bride and groom kneel on the two round bamboo mats while they listen, and afterwards kowtow. The groom then takes his new bride&#x2019;s hands and helps her up. She cannot see the flames from the bowl on the table, but she can feel the intense heat. This fire is the fire of passion, the fire of love.</p><p>Before the bride takes her first step with her husband, the groom&#x2019;s fourth brother gently brushes the soles of the bride&#x2019;s shoes with a time-worn iron filled with burning coals, to give her warmth from the end of her body right up to her...</p></p><h2>Garden of the Prophet</h2><p>The Garden of the Prophet, which Gibran intended as a companion to his masterpiece The Prophet, is a lyrical celebration of the mystical beauty of Nature.<br><br>The Kahlil Gibran Pocket Library<br><br>Since their initial publication seventy years ago, the incomparable works of Kahlil Gibran have been translated into more than twenty languages.

It was an hour before dawn but Bruno Courreges was already awake, his thoughts churning with memories and regrets about the woman who had until recently shared his bed. For a brief moment he froze, stilled by the eerie sound that carried such a weight of history and alarm. This same siren had summoned his neighbors in the small town of Saint-Denis to war and invasion, to liberation and peace, and it marked the hour of noon each day. Its swooping whine also served to call the town's volunteer firemen to their duty. Such an emergency invariably required his presence as the sole municipal policeman of Saint-Denis. The brusque summons shook him from his melancholy thoughts, and he thrust aside the tangled sheets.<br><br>As Bruno dressed and swigged from a carton of milk by way of breakfast, his cell phone rang. It was Albert, one of the two professionals who led the town's team of pompiers, and he, his truck and his night patrol were already en route.<br><br>"There's a big fire up on the old road to Saint-Chamassy," Albert began, an urgency in his voice. "It's at the top of the hill, just before the turn to Saint-Cyprien. A barn and a big field. This time of year it could spread for miles if the wind gets up."<br><br>"I'll join you there," Bruno said, tucking the phone between his shoulder and his ear as he tried to fasten his shirt buttons. He squeezed his eyes shut to draw on the map of the sprawling commune of Saint-Denis that he kept in his head. It was composed of the roads he patrolled, the isolated homes and hamlets he visited, the farms he knew, with their flocks of geese and ducks and pigs and goats that made this the gastronomic heartland of France. His familiarity with the ground over which he hunted, and searched for mushrooms after it rained, meant that he knew his district like a woman knows her own face.<br><br>"There's no report of any casualties," said Albert. "But you'd better alert the hospital as soon as you've told the mayor. I'm calling Les Ezyies and Saint-Cyprien for support. Can you stop at the station and make sure they send up the spare water tankers when the rest of the guys get in? Drive one of the tankers yourself if you have to. We'll need all the water we can find. I'll see you at the scene."<br><br>"What about evacuation? There are four or five farms up there."<br><br>"I don't know yet, but the mayor had better start phoning people to put them on alert. Get a warning out on Radio Perigord."<br><br>Bruno prayed that his elderly and sometimes temperamental van would start right away. He quickly fed his dog, left his chickens to fend for themselves and ran to the vehicle. It started at once, and he drove one-handed down the lane from his cottage toward town, thumbing the auto dial on his phone to alert first the mayor and then the chief doctor, each of whom already had been awoken by the siren. Lights were on inside people's homes, and the town was stirring as Bruno drove at high speed to the gendarmerie to tell old Jules on the night desk to call the radio station in Perigueux and to dispatch men to seal off the road near the fire. As Bruno hurried back out to his van, Captain Duroc rushed into the main building from the small barracks next door, still pulling on his uniform jacket. Bruno left Jules to explain the situation. At the fire station, Ahmed and Fabien were struggling with the towing rig for the tankers as the other volunteers were arriving, sufficient to man the trucks and tenders. Bruno drove on as fast as his van could manage, his blue light flashing and the town siren still howling into the night behind him.<br><br>By the time he reached the open road by the railway line to Sarlat, he could see the broad glow in the hills above. Bruno shivered with apprehension. Fire frightened him. He had always treated it with a wary respect, which had become something close to fear since he'd hauled some wounded French soldiers from a burning armored car during the Balkan Wars. His left arm still carried the scars. In his bedside drawer was the Croix de Guerre the government had awarded him for his efforts, after a lengthy debate among bureaucrats as to whether the Bosnian peacekeeping mission was actually a war.<br><br>Bruno wondered if there was anything in the jumble in the back of his van that might serve as protective gear. There would be gloves and a cap in his hunting jacket, his hunting boots and some swimming goggles and a bottle of water in his sports bag. Maybe there was an old tennis shirt he could soak and use as a face mask. He pushed the accelerator harder as the van labored up the hill. He knew this area well but tried in vain to remember where there might be a barn this high up on the plateau, where the land was too poor for farming. It was mainly woods and thin pasture, some tumbledown shepherds' bories of old stone, plus the tall microwave tower.<br><br>As Bruno rounded the last bend before the plateau, the whole night sky ahead seemed to pulse and glow red above the trees. He remembered the dry summer, the river so low that the tourist canoes had to search out the deeper channels. Now he could smell the burning. He slowed down. At least some of the pulsing red was the flashing light of Albert's fire truck. Bruno parked off the road. He put on his boots, gloves and hunting cap, looked at his swimming goggles and stuffed them into a pocket, poured water on the tennis shirt he had found and ran up the road to the truck, where two pompiers stood bracing the spouting hose, silhouetted against the flames.<br><br>"Not a barn, just a big wooden shed. We couldn't save it," shouted Albert over the crackling of the flames and the roaring noise of the truck. He reached into the back of the vehicle and pulled out a heavy yellow fireman's jacket and handed it to Bruno, nodding his approval of the stout boots on Bruno's feet.<br><br>"It could have been a lot worse. We were here in time to stop it from spreading to the woods."<br><br>More pulsing lights began to grow on the road as Ahmed approached with the second fire truck and the big water tanker, and then there were flashes of blue as the gendarmes arrived in their big van. Albert was calling the neighboring fire chiefs to say their help would not be needed.<br><br>"No sign of any people?" Bruno asked. Albert shook his head and ran off to direct the second truck. "How did you hear about the fire?" Bruno called after him.<br><br>"Anonymous call from the phone booth in Coux," Albert shouted back.<br><br>Bruno made a mental note of that as he tried to get his bearings. He remembered this road being thickly wooded on both sides, but where he stood there was a break in the trees, and a new-looking dirt track curved into the wide stretch of field and pasture that was burning low but steadily. What little breeze he felt on his cheeks was coming toward him and toward the woods, where the pompiers were soaking the brush to deny the flames any fresh fuel. The biggest fire was the ruin of what had been the shed, standing amid the charred crop. Bruno's foot caught on something. He looked down and saw a small metal flag, like the one farmers used to identify which seeds they had sown in which rows. He plucked it from the ground and, in the light from the truck headlights, read the words AGRICOLAE SECH G71. That meant nothing to him, but he stuffed the flag into his pocket. Shouts came from behind, and he turned to see more yellow-clad pompiers struggling up with a second hose, which bucked in their hands as it filled and a much more powerful jet of water lanced onto the edge of the woods.<br><br>"Smell anything funny?" Albert asked, suddenly looming beside him. "Come on, this way."<br><br>He led Bruno across the still smoldering ground and around the side of the shed until they were upwind, where it was quieter. Inside the shed, a metal table supporting some charred machinery was still hot enough to spit as water dripped from what was left of the roof beams. Two smoking roof timbers thrust into the sky, perched on top of what looked like an old filing cabinet. Bruno caught a stink of burned plastic and rubber, and something else.<br><br>"Gasoline?" he asked.<br><br>"That's what I think. We'll send some trace evidence off to the lab in Bordeaux, but I'll bet this was deliberate. If you go over to the far side of the field, you'll smell it again. Somebody was thorough--he got the crops, the shed, everything. This is going to be a job for you a lot more than for me."<br><br>"If it's arson, it's the Police Nationale," said Bruno. It would be a good idea to seal off the phone booth in Coux to check fingerprints, Bruno thought.<br><br>"If it's arson against crops," said Albert, "it's local. Some farmers' feud or somebody's been playing games with another man's wife. And that means the Police Nationale won't have the first idea where to start."<br><br>Bruno nodded, peering at something in the shed that struck him as odd. "Albert, have you ever seen a filing cabinet and office stuff like that in a farmer's shed in the middle of a field?"<br><br>"No. Looks like it could be a computer, though there's no electricity up here. Maybe it's an old typewriter."<br><br>Bruno turned away and was walking across to the point where the charred crops stopped when an explosion came with a flat crunch. Light flared, and a rush of heat stunned him as he turned and saw Albert topple to his knees amid the debris of the shed, which was bright with new flames.<br><br>His forearm up to protect his eyes against the searing heat, Bruno ran instinctively toward Albert and grabbed him by the collar. Fighting down fear as he plunged into the flames that seemed hungry to engulf him, Bruno hauled Albert back. The fire chief's legs dragged limply through the flaring wood of the shed, and his trousers were on fire. Once the two men were clear of danger, Bruno spread-eagled himself over Albert's legs to douse the flames with the fireproof material of his jacket. And then the other firemen were there, spraying them both with foam from handheld extinguishers.<br><br>Ahmed hauled Bruno up and shone a flashlight into his face, shouting, "You okay?" while others tended to Albert. Bruno nodded, shook himself and rose a little jerkily to his feet, brushing away the thick foam that covered him.<br><br>"A bit scorched, but nothing serious thanks to that jacket Albert gave me," he said. "What the hell was that explosion?"<br><br>"An aerosol; maybe a can of paint or kerosene. Some bastards leave an almost empty fuel container at the scene and close the cap. The vapor can make it go off like a bomb once it's hot enough," Ahmed said with a shrug. "Albert never should have gotten that close. We'd have carried on hosing it but we had to put water on the edge of the fire, stop it from reaching the woods."<br><br>"My fault," said Bruno. "I was asking him about the equipment inside the shed."<br><br>Albert had been lifted to his feet and was shaking his head to clear it, flecks of the foam flying off from his helmet and jacket. Bruno asked him how he was.<br><br>"I'll live to make a fool of myself another day. Some damn thing hit me on the ear," said Albert. He put his hand up to the side of his head and it came away bright with blood. One of the firemen gave him a bottle of water; he drank deeply, then rinsed his mouth, spat and looked across at Bruno and nodded once. "Thanks," he said quietly, handing him the water. Albert's hand was trembling. So, Bruno noticed, was his own.<br><br>"How are the legs?" Bruno asked. His voice was hoarse, and his throat hurt. The thought of the gasoline and of the fire being set deliberately brought a surge of anger and a sudden sharp memory of the airfield at Sarajevo, the crunch of mortars and the screams of the men inside the armored car. Bruno had often wondered if he'd ever be able to go back into a fire. Now he knew, but he shuddered and took a deep breath to control himself.<br><br>"Not bad. I wear flameproof undertrousers, just like the race car drivers," Albert said, his voice raised. He spoke quickly as the adrenaline rushed through his system. "I'm okay, just a bit dizzy from whatever hit me."<br><br>More shouting erupted from behind them, and another fireman came running up.<br><br>"Hey Chief, there's a water main. The gendarmes just ran into a standpipe."<br><br>Albert looked at Bruno and rolled his eyes. "Probably the first time our Captain Duroc ever found anything, and even then he had to run into it."<br><br>They headed back to the road, where a jet of water was fountaining high from a broken standpipe and Fabien was doing something violent with a heavy wrench in the light of the only headlight on the gendarmes' van that wasn't broken. Captain Duroc could be heard shouting angrily at his men. Fabien gave a final twist of his wrench and the water stopped.<br><br>"We can use this now," he said. "There's not much pressure, but enough to damp down the embers."<br><br>"Where's that pipe going? Why isn't it on my maps?" Albert demanded angrily, mopping at his bloodied ear with a handkerchief.<br><br>"Looks like it goes from the water tower to the microwave station. That's Ministry of Defense, so they have a guard post," said Fabien. "And this standpipe is here because they have another pipe going off to that shed and the field. Looks to me like there's some fancy irrigation system installed."<br><br>"Irrigation? Up here?" said Albert. "Somebody's got more money than sense."<br><br>"Funny that the one field that has its own piped water supply is the one that gets torched," said Bruno. "You ever heard of this Agricolae?" He reached into his pocket and pulled out the small metal flag he had plucked from the ground.<br><br>"No. Could be some experimental seed, I suppose, but I never heard of anything like that up here."<br><br>They went back to the truck, where the elderly mayor, Gerard Mangin, stood patiently by the road. Behind him was a row of parked cars belonging to locals who had come to watch the excitement.</p><h2>Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich-30TH ANNIV EDITION: A History of Nazi Germany</h2><p>Before the Nazies could destroy the files, famed foreign correspondent and historian William L. Shirer sifted through the massive self-documentation of the Third Reich, to create a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind--now in a special 30th anniversary edition.<br>"One of the most important works of history of our time."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES</p><p>William L. Shirer's THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH is a monumental study of the 20th Century's most frightening moments. Now, 53 years after the end of World War II, it may seem incredible that our most valued institutions, and way of life, were threatened by the menace that Hitler and the Third Reich represented. Shirer's description of events and the cast of characters who played such pivotal roles in defining the course Europe was to take is unforgettable.<br><br>Benefiting from his many years as a reporter, and thus a personal observer of the rise of Nazi Germany, and availing himself of some of the 485 tons of documents from the German Foreign Office, captured by the First Army, as well as countless other diaries, phone transcriptions, and other written records, meticulously kept at every level by the Germans, Shirer has put together a brutally objective account of how Hitler wrested political control of Germany, and planned and executed his 6 year quest to dominate the world, only at the end, to see Germany go down in flames.<br><br>The combination of personal recollection and amassing of historical evidence distinguishes this book as one of the great historical works of any time. For instance, he recounts that, from his apartment in Plosslgasse, in Vienna, he personally witnessed how perhaps half of Vienna's 180,000 Jews bargained their way to freedom in 1938.<br><br>Shirer explains that Hitler believed that France and England were too weak to pose much of a threat to his ambitions to subjugate Czechoslovakia, and later Poland. The momentary relief of Russia as a threat to his domination of Europe as a result of the flurry of diplomatic activity that proceeded his invasion of Poland is fascinating. There is no relief, throughout his narrative, of the brutality of Hitler and such a large contingent of Germans who populate this narrative.<br><br>Although 1600 pages long, this is such a richly rewarding experience for anyone who wants to come to grips with the mysterious question as to how this menace to civilization ever came into being, much less was sustained for as long as it was. The answer, unfortunately, is that most of Germany, for a whole host of reasons, embraced Nazism and the fanaticism that Hitler engendered.<br><br>For another book that deals with this problem, why so much of Germany lent its support to Hitler, I heartily recommend HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONER'S, by Daniel Goldhagen, published by Vintage Books. Although filled with perhaps more statistical details then the non-professional historian would need, this book helps to adumbrate the themes in Shirer's great book.<br><br>George Davidson, Director of Production, The Ballantine Publishing Group<b>Ron Rosenbaum </b>is the bestselling author of <i>Explaining Hitler </i>and <i>The Shakespeare Wars </i>and has written or edited six<i> </i>other books.

Following these twin disasters, Haruki Murakami abandoned his life abroad and returned home to confront his country&#x2019;s grief. The subway attack led to his recent Underground. And out of the quake come these six stories, set in the months between natural catastrophe and man-made terrorism. His characters find their resolutely normal everyday lives undone by events even more surreal (yet somehow believable) than we have come to expect in his fiction.<br><br>An electronics salesman, abruptly deserted by his wife, is entrusted to deliver a mysterious package but gets more than he bargained for at the receiving end; a Thai chauffeur takes his troubled charge to a seer, who penetrates her deepest sorrow; and, in the unforgettable title story, a boy acknowledges a shattering secret about his past that will change his life forever.<br><br>But the most compelling character of all is the earthquake itself&#x2014;slipping into and out of view almost imperceptibly, but nonetheless reaching deep into the lives of these forlorn citizens of the apocalypse. The terrible damage visible all around is, in fact, less extreme than the inconsolable howl of a nation indelibly scarred&#x2014;an experience in which Murakami discovers many truths about compassion, courage, and the nature of human suffering.</p><p>Haruki Murakami, a writer both mystical and hip, is the West's favorite Japanese novelist. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Murakami lived abroad until 1995. That year, two disasters struck Japan: the lethal earthquake in Kobe and the deadly poison gas attacks in the Tokyo subway. Spurred by these tragic events, Murakami returned home. The stories in <i>After the Quake</i> are set in the months that fell between the earthquake and the subway attack, presenting a world marked by despair, hope, and a kind of human instinct for transformation. A teenage girl and a middle-aged man share a hobby of making beach bonfires; a businesswoman travels to Thailand and, quietly, confronts her own death; three friends act out a modern-day Tokyo version of <i>Jules and Jim</i>. There's a surreal element running through the collection in the form of unlikely frogs turning up in unlikely places. News of the earthquake hums throughout. The book opens with the dull buzz of disaster-watching: "Five straight days she spent in front of the television, staring at the crumbled banks and hospitals, whole blocks of stores in flames, severed rail lines and expressways."

They might have been the northern lights, her own personal aurora borealis. But they weren&#x2019;t, they were just neon lights and streetlights rendered blurred and prismatic by vodka. Maya blinked, trying to dislodge the colors from her field of vision. But they were stuck, as though someone had been scribbling on her eyeballs. She closed her eyes for a moment, but without vision, her balance went and she could feel herself begin to sway. She grabbed something. She did not realize until the sharp bark and shrug that accompanied her action that it was a human being. <br> <br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Maya said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>The person tutted and backed away from her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maya took exaggerated offense to the person&#x2019;s lack of kindness.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; she said to the outline of the person, whose gender she had failed to ascertain. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your problem?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Er,&#x201d; said the person, looking Maya up and down, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ll find you&#x2019;re the one with the problem.&#x201d; Then the person, a woman, yes, in red shoes, tutted again and walked away, her heels issuing a mocking clack-clack against the pavement as she went. <br> <br>Maya watched her blurred figure recede. She found a lamppost and leaned against it, looking into the oncoming traffic. The headlights turned into more fireworks. Or one of those toys she&#x2019;d had as a child: tube, full of colored beads, you shook it, looked through the hole, lovely patterns&#x2014;what was it called? She couldn&#x2019;t remember. Whatever. She didn&#x2019;t know anymore. She didn&#x2019;t know what time it was. She didn&#x2019;t know where she was. Adrian had called. She&#x2019;d spoken to him. Tried to sound sober. He&#x2019;d asked her if she needed him to come and get her. She couldn&#x2019;t remember what she&#x2019;d said. Or how long ago that had been. Lovely Adrian. So lovely. She couldn&#x2019;t go home. Go home and do what she needed to do. He was too nice. She remembered the pub. She&#x2019;d talked to that woman. Promised her she was going home. That was hours ago. Where had she been since then? Walking. Sitting somewhere, on a bench, with a bottle of vodka, talking to strangers. Hahaha! That bit had been fun. Those people had been fun. They&#x2019;d said she could come back with them, to their flat, have a party. She&#x2019;d been tempted, but she was glad now, glad she&#x2019;d said no.<br> <br>She closed her eyes, gripped the lamppost tighter as she felt her balance slip away from her. She smiled to herself. This was nice. This was nice. All this color and darkness and noise and all these fascinating people. She should do this more often, she really should. Get out of it. Live a little. Go a bit nuts. A group of women were walking towards her. She stared at them greedily. She could see each woman in triplicate. They were all so young, so pretty. She closed her eyes again as they passed by, her senses unable to contain their images any longer. Once they&#x2019;d passed she opened her eyes. <br> <br>She saw a bus bearing down, bouncy and keen. She squinted into the white light on the front, looking for a number. It slowed as it neared her and she turned and saw that there was a bus stop to her left, with people standing at it.<br> <br>Dear Bitch. Why can&#x2019;t you just disappear?<br> <br>The words passed through her mind, clear and concise in their meaning, like a sober person leading her home. And then those other words, the words from earlier.<br> <br>I hate her too.<br> <br>She took a step forward.</p><h2>Dear America: Behind The Masks</h2><p>Newbery Award-winning author Susan Patron brings her talents to the beloved Dear America series in this exciting story of a girl growing up in the Wild West, in a California gold mining town.<br><br>Growing up in the wild gold-mining town of Bodie, California, in the 1880s, Angeline Reddy has seen it all -- saloons, brawls, and a whole lot of desperation.

Providing pastors and Bible students with a comprehensive and scholarly tool for the exposition of the Scriptures and the teaching and proclamation of their message, this twelve-volume reference work has become a staple of seminary and college libraries and pastors&#39; studies worldwide. The seventy-eight contributors come from the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Australia, and New Zealand, and from many denominations, including Anglican, Baptist, Brethren, Methodist, Nazarene, Presbyterian, and Reformed. They represent the best in evangelical scholarship committed to the divine inspiration, complete trustworthiness, and full authority of the Bible. The Expositor&#39;s Bible Commentary uses the New International Version for its English text, but also refers freely to other translations and to the original languages. Each book of the Bible has, in addition to its exposition, an introduction, outline, and bibliography. Notes on textual questions and special problems are correlated with the expository units; transliteration and translation of Semitic and Greek words make the more technical notes accessible to readers unacquainted with the biblical languages. In matters where marked differences of opinion exist, commentators, while stating their own convictions, deal fairly and irenically with opposing views.

(Getting to Know the World's Greatest Artists Series). CIP. Childrens. 1988. PLB $9.95. Grade 1-3 Despite the current trend to introduce music, literature, and art to very young children, these books serve to illustrate the limitations of such efforts. Here the lives and works of two brilliant and revolutionary painters have been reduced to a series of basic facts and cliches. Children reading these books will get less biographic information than could be found in an encyclopedia and no insight into the unique vision and talent that made these artists important. Venezia's analysis of the artists' style is simplistiche attributes Picasso's blue period to depression over the death of a friend and his rose period to a new love. He makes no attempt to explain the principals of Cubism, focusing on the peculiarities of the images rather than the ideas behind them. His treatment of Rembrandt's work is equally shallow, describing the objects pictured rather than the artist's interpretation. Although he mentions the variety of brush strokes in one Rembrandt painting, he spends more time pointing out the spilled glasses of wine in the painting and never mentions Rembrandt's signature use of light and shadow or the richness and warmth of his color. In addition to reproductions of the paintings, captioned cartoons illustrate the text. The combination of jokes and simplicity creates an overall sense of condescension.

No International or Priority.</p><p>This catalog for a show of 150 American watercolors from the Brooklyn Museum of Art's collection of nearly 800 works is more than an exhibition monograph. It is a celebration of the museum's active participation in collecting watercolors and a reminder of its role in recognizing and establishing them as a prime American medium. In seven well-documented essays, Ferber and Gallati trace Brooklyn's role in the early purchase of works by such artists as Sargent, Homer, and major figures of the 20th century. A chronology distills events and provides a framework from which Brooklyn's contributions to art in America can be told. Some 46 black-and-white illustrations augment the 150 color plates; works range from landscapes and seascapes to figurative portraits and abstractions.

The world around us moves faster than ever before. We strain to be more efficient, to cram more into each minute, each hour, each day. Since the Industrial Revolution shifted the world into high gear, the cult of speed has pushed us to abreaking point. Consider these facts: Americans spend 40 percent less time with their children than they did in the 1960s; the average American spends seventy-two minutes of every day behind the wheel of a car; a typical business executive now loses sixty-eight hours a year to being put on hold; and American adults currently devote on average a meager half hour per week to making love.</p><p>Living on the edge of exhaustion, we are constantly reminded by our bodies and minds that the pace of life is spinning out of control. <em>In Praise of Slowness</em> traces the history of our increasingly breathless relationship with time, and tackles the consequences and conundrum of living in this accelerated culture of our own creation. Why are we always in such a rush? What is the cure for time-sickness? Is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down? Realizing the price we pay for unrelenting speed, people all over the world are reclaiming their time and slowing down the pace -- and living happier, more productive, and healthier lives as a result. A Slow revolution is taking place.</p><p>But here you will find no Luddite calls to overthrow technology and seek a pre-industrial utopia. This is a modern revolution, championed by e-mailing, cell phone-using lovers of sanity. The Slow philosophy can be summed up in a single word -- balance. People are discovering energy and efficiency where we may have least expected -- in slowing down.</p><p>In this engaging and entertaining exploration, award-winning journalist and rehabilitated speedaholic Carl Honor� details our perennial love affair with efficiency and speed in a perfect blend of anecdotal reportage, history, and intellectual inquiry. <em>In Praise of Slowness</em> is the first comprehensive look at the worldwide Slow movements making their way into the mainstream -- in offices, factories, neighborhoods, kitchens, hospitals, concert halls, bedrooms, gyms, and schools. Defining a movement that is here to stay, this spirited manifesto will make you completely rethink your relationship with time.</p></p><p>In the tradition of such trailblazing books as No Logo and The Tipping Point, In Praise of Slow heralds a growing international movement of people dedicated to slowing down the pace of our contemporary times and enjoying a richer, fuller life as a result. <br>These days, almost everyone complains about the hectic pace of their lives. We live in a world where speed rules and everyone is under pressure to go faster. But when speed is king, anyone or anything that gets in our way, that slows us down, becomes an enemy. Thanks to speed, we are living in the age of rage. <br>Carl Honore has discovered a movement that is quickly working its way into the mainstream. Groups of people are developing a recipe for living better in a fast-paced, modern environment by striving for a new balance between fast and slow. In an entertaining and hands-on investigation of this new movement, Honore takes us from a Tantric sex workshop in a trendy neighbourhood in London, England to Bra, Italy, the home of the Slow Food, Slow Cities and Slow Sex movements. He examines how we can continue to live productive lives by embracing the tenets of the slow movement. <br>A challenging take on the cult of speed, as well as a corrective look at how we can approach our lives with new understanding, In Praise of Slow uncovers a movement whose time has come.<p>Carl Honore is an award-winning journalist and author whose revolutionary first book, <em>In Praise of Slowness</em>, was an international bestseller and has been published in more than thirty languages. Honor� is a highly sought after lecturer who speaks around the world on slow living and the Slow Movement, and his work has appeared in publications including <em>The Economist</em>, <em>Observer</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>The Miami Herald</em>, <em>Houston Chronicle</em>, <em>TIME</em> magazine, and <em>National Post</em>.

The mental exercise that audio gives to the imagination has more positive effects on kids than the mind-numbing boob tube. Perhaps that&#39;s why, when Disney rereleased some of its postwar kids albums on cassette a few years ago, they were sold out within weeks of hitting the shelves. In this instance, even merely serviceable performance does wonders for Stine&#39;s hack writing. Disney has pumped more energy than creativity into the slickly produced title. It&#39;s amiable, briskly paced and safe. Neither parents nor their offspring will find any unpleasant shocks here.

Did a deadly genetic disease help our ancestors survive the bubonic plagues of Europe? Will a visit to the tanning salon help lower your cholesterol? Why do we age? Why are some people immune to HIV? Can your genes be turned on -- or off?</p><p>Joining the ranks of modern myth busters, Dr. Sharon Moalem turns our current understanding of illness on its head and challenges us to fundamentally change the way we think about our bodies, our health, and our relationship to just about every other living thing on earth, from plants and animals to insects and bacteria.</p><p>Through a fresh and engaging examination of our evolutionary history, Dr. Moalem reveals how many of the conditions that are diseases today actually gave our ancestors a leg up in the survival sweepstakes. When the option is a long life with a disease or a short one without it, evolution opts for disease almost every time.</p><p>Everything from the climate our ancestors lived in to the crops they planted and ate to their beverage of choice can be seen in our genetic inheritance. But Survival of the Sickest doesn't stop there. It goes on to demonstrate just how little modern medicine really understands about human health, and offers a new way of thinking that can help all of us live longer, healthier lives.</p><p>Survival of the Sickest is filled with fascinating insights and cutting-edge research, presented in a way that is both accessible and utterly absorbing.

With the simplest of tests (often an auction or a quiz given under a few conditions) he shows again and again not only that we are wired to make irrational decisions in many situations, but that we do so in remarkably predictable ways. <p> <i> I have always been puzzled by the way in which genetic diseases have managed to survive throughout the ages. How could it be that these diseases were able to withstand the evolutionary process, where only the most fit survive, and continue to be transferred from one generation to the next? </i>Survival of the Sickest<i> provides a thought provoking yet entertaining explanation to this puzzle. </i></p><p><i> In this insightful book Dr. Sharon Moalem demonstrates how conditions that are considered unhealthy (such as hemochromatosis, diabetes, and high cholesterol), or even deadly in extreme cases, might actually put their carriers at an advantage in combating other life-threatening illnesses. For example, he explains that hemochromatosis, a disease that, if left untreated, will kill you, may have actually been a defense against the deadliest pandemic in history--the bubonic plague during the 14th century. It turns out that this genetic mutation, which continues to be passed down through generations, actually helped spare many lives at one point. </i></p><p><i> Throughout the book, Dr. Moalem draws many connections between seemingly disparate subjects, such as the accidental invention of ice wine and cold diuresis, in order to illustrate the basic mechanisms of genetics and medicine in charming and intuitive ways. He skillfully interweaves his knowledge of history, genetics, and medicine not only as they relate to specific medical conditions but also in a way that addresses important challenges of modern society and our future evolution. </i></p><p><i> In the most general terms, Dr. Moalem's description of the human body and its complexity left me in awe of how far we have come in our understanding of biology and medicine, while also being reminded that the road to understanding ourselves is still wide open with much more to learn in the decades, and even centuries, to come.

I am eleven years old. I have hair the color of carrots in apricot glaze (recipe to follow), skin fair and clear where it isn't freckled, and eyes like summer storms.<br><br>Readers will know right from the start that the narrator of<i> Everything on a Waffle</i> is going to tell her story straight and pull no punches. Primrose's parents have been lost at sea, but she believes without an iota of doubt that they are still alive, somewhere. She moves in with her Uncle Jack, but feels generally friendless. Her only real refuge is a local restaurant called The Girl on the Red Swing, where the owner, Miss Bowzer, serves everything on waffles -- except advice and good sense, which come free of charge and are always reliable.<br><br>Food in general plays an important role in Primrose's journey toward peace and understanding (a recipe dictated in her unmistakable voice is appended to each chapter), and readers will eagerly cheer her on through this funny, bittersweet novel.<br><br></p><p>In the small Canadian town of Coal Harbour, in a quaint restaurant called The Girl on the Red Swing, everything comes on a waffle--lasagna, fish, you name it. Even waffles! Eleven-year-old Primrose Squarp loves this homey place, especially its owner, Kate Bowzer, who takes her under her wing, teaches her how to cook, and doesn't patronize or chastise her, even when she puts her guinea pig too close to the oven and it catches fire. Primrose can use a little extra attention. Her parents were lost at sea, and everyone but her thinks they are dead. Her Uncle Jack, who kindly takes her in, is perfectly nice, but doesn't have much time on his hands. Miss Perfidy, her paid babysitter-guardian, smells like mothballs and really doesn't like children, and her school guidance counselor, Miss Honeycut, an uppity British woman of the world, is too caught up in her own long-winded stories to be any kind of confidante. Nobody knows what exactly to think of young Primrose, and Primrose doesn't quite know what to make of her small community, either.<p> She entertains herself in a variety of ways--mostly by wryly observing those around her with wisdom, compassion, and slightly cynical humor that belie her years. She also sits on the dock and waits for her parents to get back, goes to the store and tells the grocer the cottage cheese has expired (not appreciated), and writes recipes that her mother taught her in a memo pad. About Caramel Apples, she writes: "Do not muck around with chocolate or nuts or anything else fancy that may tempt you. It will only gum up the works. Sometimes you get tempted to make something wonderful even better, but in doing so you lose what was so wonderful to begin with." <i>Everything on a Waffle</i> is ultimately a folksy, Garrison Keillor-style take on small-town life, spiced with sometimes hilarious, sometimes poignant anecdotes about the quirks and adventures of individual townspeople as seen through Primrose's wise eyes. It's a quiet, but very funny book, infused with the hope of a girl who knows in her heart that there are things that science, and even the uppity Miss Honeycut, can't explain. We first were introduced to author Polly Horvath with her National Book Award finalist, <i>The Trolls</i>, which you absolutely have to read if you haven't already! (Ages 9 to 13) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>leen McInerney<br>Approx. 3 hrs. 30 mins.<br>2 cassettes<br><br>Primrose Squarp simply <i>knows</i> her parents did not perish at sea during a terrible storm, despite what the other residents of Coal Harbour believe. For all practical purposes, Primrose is an orphan, and there's no great clamoring of prospective adopters. After realizing the impracticality of continuing to pay Miss Perfidy (a mothball-scented elderly lady) an hourly wage to baby-sit her, the town council places her with Uncle Jack, who reluctantly takes her in. Primrose does warm up to him, but her true sanctuary is a local restaurant called The Girl on the Red Swing, where everything--including lasagna--is served on a waffle, and where the proprietor Miss Bowzer offers a willing ear.<br><br>Through a mixture of eccentric humor and probing philosophy, author Polly Horvath makes Primrose's search for peace and understanding a most memorable one.</p><h2>Sun Signs (How to really know your husband wife lover child boss employee yourself through astrology)</h2><p>This item condition is New.

Betrayed by his true love, Guinevere, Arthur must face his enemies -- who were once his friends -- in final, mortal combat. He must also face his most daunting challenge of all.

Mordred reigns with a brutal hand, and Arthur sees his dreams of peace evaporate. The author provides exciting descriptions of swordplay and battles, interspersed with somewhat gruesome depictions of ordinary life in those days--greasy, waist-length beards serving as napkins, lambs bloodily sacrificed before festivals, and rampant lice.<p> But at the heart of <i>Excalibur</i>--what makes the Arthurian legends eternally fascinating--is the larger-than-life company of heroes, from Sagramor the warrior to Taliesin the bard, Guinevere, Lancelot, and Arturus Rex himself.

But, well, that&#x2019;s gossip too.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So Leteo is legit?&#x201d; I sit down by the sandbox no one plays in because of ringworm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brendan paces back and forth, dribbling our friend Deon&#x2019;s basketball between his legs. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why Kyle and his family bounced,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Fresh start.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t even have to ask what he forgot. Kyle&#x2019;s identical twin brother, Kenneth, was gunned down last December for sleeping with this guy Jordan&#x2019;s younger sister. Kyle was the one who actually slept with her, though. I know grief just fine, but I can&#x2019;t imagine living day by day with that&#x2014;knowing the brother I shared a face and secret language with was ripped out of my life when the bullets were meant for me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, good luck to him, right?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, sure,&#x201d; Brendan says.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The usual suspects are outside today. Skinny-Dave and Fat-Dave&#x2014;who are unrelated, just both named Dave&#x2014;come out of our local bodega, Good Food&#x2019;s Store, where I&#x2019;ve been working part-time for the past couple of months. They&#x2019;re throwing back quarter juices and potato chips. Baby Freddy glides on by with his new steel orange bike, and I remember when we used to give him shit years ago for still needing training wheels&#x2014;but the joke is on me since my father never got a chance to teach me to ride at all. Me-Crazy is sitting on the ground, having a conversation with the wall; and everyone else, the adults mainly, are preparing for this weekend&#x2019;s community event of the year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be the first time we&#x2019;re celebrating Family Day without Kenneth and Kyle, or Brendan&#x2019;s parents, or my dad. It&#x2019;s not like Dad and I were gonna have father&#x2013;son wheelbarrow races or father&#x2013;son basketball games; besides, Dad always paired up with my brother, Eric. But father&#x2013;son anything would&#x2019;ve been better than this. I can&#x2019;t imagine it&#x2019;s any easier for Brendan, even though his parents are both alive. It might be worse, since they&#x2019;re just out of reach in boxy jail cells for separate crimes: his mother for armed robbery, his father for assaulting a police officer after he was caught dealing meth. Now he lives with his grandfather who is thugging it out at eighty-eight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s going to expect smiles from us,&#x201d; I say.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Everyone can go suck it,&#x201d; Brendan replies. He pockets his hands, and I bet there&#x2019;s weed in there; dealing pot has been his way of growing up faster, even though it&#x2019;s pretty much what landed his dad in prison eight months ago. He checks his watch, struggling to read what the hands are saying. &#x201c;I have to go meet someone.&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t even wait for me to respond before he walks off.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;s a guy of few words, which is why he&#x2019;s only my sort of best friend. A real best friend would use a lot of words to make you feel somewhat good about your life when you&#x2019;re thinking about ending it. Like I tried to. Instead, he distanced himself from me because he felt as if he had a duty to hang with the other black kids&#x2014;which I thought and still think is bullshit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I miss the time when we took full advantage of summer nights, ignoring curfew so we could lie down on the black mat of the jungle gym and talk about girls and futures too big for us&#x2014;which always seemed like it might be okay, as long we were stuck here with each other. Now we come outside because of routine, not brotherhood.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#x2019;s just one more thing I have to pretend I&#x2019;m okay with.<br><br>Home is a one-bedroom apartment for the four of us. I mean, three of us. Three.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I share the living room with Eric, who should be home any minute now from his shift at the used video game store on Third Avenue. He&#x2019;ll power on one of his two gaming consoles, chat with his online friends through a headset, and play until his team bows out around 4 a.m. I bet Mom will try and get him to apply to some colleges. I don&#x2019;t plan on sticking around for the argument.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are stacks of unread comics on my side of the room. I bought a lot of them for cheap, like between seventy-five cents and two dollars at my favorite comic shop, without any real intention to read them from start to finish. I just like having a collection to show off whenever one of my more well-off friends comes over. I subscribed to one series, The Dark Alternates, when everyone got into it at school last year, but so far I&#x2019;ve only gotten around to flipping through them to see if the artists have done anything interesting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I really get into a book, I draw my favorite scenes inside them: in <i>World War Z</i>, I drew the Battle of Yonkers where zombies dominated; in <i>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</i>, I drew the moment we meet the Headless Horseman because that was when I suddenly cared about an otherwise so-so ghost story; and, in <i>Scorpius Hawthorne and the Convict of Abbadon</i>&#x2014;the third book in my favorite fantasy series about a demonic boy wizard&#x2014;I drew the monstrous Abbadon being split into two from Scorpius&#x2019;s Sever Charm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven&#x2019;t been drawing very much lately.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The shower always takes a few minutes to heat up so I turn it on and go check on my mom. I knock on her bedroom door, and she doesn&#x2019;t answer. The TV is on, though. When your only living parent isn&#x2019;t responding, you can&#x2019;t help but think of that time when your father was found dead in the bathtub&#x2014;and the possibility that beyond your home&#x2019;s only bedroom door life as an orphan awaits you. So I go inside.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She&#x2019;s just waking up from her second nap of the day to an episode of <i>Law &amp; Order</i>. &#x201c;You okay, Mom?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, my son.&#x201d; She rarely calls me Aaron or &#x201c;my baby&#x201d; anymore, and while I was never a fan of the latter, especially whenever my friends were around, at least it showed that there was life inside of her. Now she&#x2019;s just wiped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside her is a half-eaten slice of pizza she asked me to get her from Yolanda&#x2019;s Pizzeria, the empty cup of coffee I brought her back from Joey&#x2019;s, and a couple of Leteo pamphlets she picked up on her own. She&#x2019;s always believed in the procedure, but that means nothing to me since she also believes in Santeria. She puts on her glasses, which conveniently hide the sunken lines around her eyes from her crazy work hours. She&#x2019;s a social worker at Washington Hospital five days a week, and spends four evenings handling meat at the supermarket for extra cash to keep this tiny roof over our heads.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t like the pizza? I can get you something else.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom ignores this. She gets out of bed, tugging at the collar of her sister&#x2019;s hand-me-down shirt she recently lost enough weight to fit into because of her &#x201c;Poverty Diet,&#x201d; and hugs me harder than she has since Dad died. &#x201c;I wish there was something else we could&#x2019;ve done.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Uh . . .&#x201d; I hug her back, never knowing what to say when she cries about what Dad did and what I tried to do. I just look at the Leteo pamphlets again. There is something else we could&#x2019;ve done for him&#x2014;we just never would&#x2019;ve been able to afford it. &#x201c;I should probably shower before the water gets cold again. Sorry.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; She lets me go. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, my son.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I pretend everything is okay as I rush to the bathroom where steam has fogged up the mirror. I quickly undress. But I stop before stepping in because the tub&#x2014;finally clean after lots of bleach&#x2014;remains the spot where he took his life. His memories sucker punch my brother and me at every turn: the pen marks on the wall where he measured our height; the king-sized bed where he would flip us while watching the news; the stove where he cooked empanadas for our birthdays. We can&#x2019;t exactly just<br>escape these things by moving into a different, bigger apartment. No, we&#x2019;re stuck here in this place where we have to shake mouse shit out of our shoes and inspect our glasses of soda before drinking in case roaches dived in while our backs were turned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our hot water doesn&#x2019;t run hot for very long so I jump in before I miss my chance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I rest my head against the wall, the water sliding through my hair and down my back, and I think about all the memories I would want Leteo to bury. They all have to do with living in a post-Dad world. I flip over my wrist and stare at my scar. I can&#x2019;t believe I was once that guy who carved a smile into his wrist because he couldn&#x2019;t find happiness, that guy who thought he would find it in death. No matter what drove my dad to kill himself&#x2014;his tough upbringing in a home with eight older brothers, or his job at the infamous post office up the block, or any one of a million reasons&#x2014;I have to push ahead with the people who don&#x2019;t take the easy way out, who love me enough to stay alive even when life sucks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I trace the smiling scar, left to right and right to left, happy to have it as a reminder not to be such a dumbass again.</p><h2>Mirrors &amp; Windows: Connecting with Literature, American Tradition</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p></p><h2>Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There</h2><p>Profiles two formerly mutually exclusive groups of people--the business-driven bourgeois and the intellectually driven artistic bohemians--noting how in the last decade they have merged to create a single social ethos.</p><p>You've seen them: They sip double-tall, nonfat lattes, chat on cell phones, and listen to NPR while driving their immaculate SUVs to Pottery Barn to shop for $48 titanium spatulas. They tread down specialty cheese aisles in top-of-the-line hiking boots and think nothing of laying down $5 for an olive-wheatgrass muffin. They're the bourgeois bohemians--"Bobos"--an unlikely blend of mainstream culture and 1960s-era counterculture that, according to David Brooks, represents both America's present and future: "These Bobos define our age. They are the new establishment. Their hybrid culture is the atmosphere we all breathe. Their status codes now govern social life." Amusing stereotypes aside, they're an "elite based on brainpower" and merit rather than pedigree or lineage: "Dumb good-looking people with great parents have been displaced by smart, ambitious, educated, and antiestablishment people with scuffed shoes." <p> <i>Bobos in Paradise</i> is a brilliant, breezy, and often hilarious study of the "cultural consequences of the information age." Large and influential (especially in terms of their buying power), the Bobos have reformed society through culture rather than politics, and Brooks clearly outlines this passing of the high-class torch by analyzing nearly all aspects of life: consumption habits, business and lifestyle choices, entertainment, spirituality, politics, and education. Employing a method he calls "comic sociology," Brooks relies on keen observations, wit, and intelligence rather than statistics and hard theory to make his points. And by copping to his own Bobo status, he comes across as revealing rather than spiteful in his dead-on humor. Take his description of a typical grocery store catering to discriminating Bobos: "The visitor to Fresh Fields is confronted with a big sign that says 'Organic Items today: 130.' This is like a barometer of virtue. If you came in on a day when only 60 items were organic, you'd feel cheated. But when the number hits the three figures, you can walk through the aisles with moral confidence."</p><p> Like any self-respecting Bobo, Brooks wears his erudition lightly and comfortably (not unlike, say, an expedition-weight triple-layer Gore-Tex jacket suitable for a Mount Everest assault but more often seen in the gym). But just because he's funny doesn't mean this is not a serious book. On the contrary, it is one of the more insightful works of social commentary in recent memory. His ideas are sharp, his writing crisp, and he even offers pointed suggestions for putting the considerable Bobo political clout to work. And, unlike the classes that spawned them--the hippies and the yuppies--Brooks insists the Bobos are here to stay: "Today the culture war is over, at least in the realm of the affluent. The centuries-old conflict has been reconciled." All the more reason to pay attention. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>David Brooks</b> is a senior editor at <i>The Weekly Standard,</i> a contributing editor at <i>Newsweek,</i> and a commentator on NPR and <i>The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.</i> He was formerly a reporter and editor at <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i> His articles have appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker, SmartMoney, The New Republic, Commentary,</i> and other publications.

"The tales of Greek mythology do not throw any clear light upon what early mankind was like," Hamilton explains in her introduction. "They do throw an abundance of light upon what early Greeks were like--a matter, it would seem, of more importance to us, who are their descendents intellectually, artistically, and politically. Nothing we learn about them is alien to ourselves." Fans of Greek mythology will find all the great stories and characters here--Perseus, Hercules, and Odysseus--each discussed in generous detail by the voice of an impressively knowledgeable and engaging (with occasional lapses) narrator. This is also an excellent primer for middle- and high-school students who are studying ancient Greek and Roman culture and literature. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>MONSTERS, MORTALS, GODS, AND WARRIORS<p>For over fifty years readers have chosen this book above all others to discover the thrilling, enchanting, and fascinating world of Western mythology. From Odysseus's adventure-filled journey to the Norse god Odin's effort to postpone the final day of doom, Edith Hamilton's classic collection not only retells these stories with brilliant clarity but shows us how the ancients saw their own place in the world and how their themes echo in our consciousness today. An essential part of every home library, MYTHOLOGY is the definitive volume for anyone who wants to know the key dramas, the primary characters, the triumphs, failures, fears, and hopes first narrated thousands of years ago -- and still spellbinding to this day.</p></p><h2>Vampire Hunter D, Vol. 2: Raiser of Gales</h2><p>The adventures of Vampire Hunter D continue!<br><br>Vampires: murderous creatures in the shape of humans, they stalk the night feeding on the blood of innocents.

The good and simple truth to which each of Berry's stories testifies is that its author observes people carefully, understands them precisely, and cares about them deeply; bombast, pretension, and narcissism are alien to him...

Rodale founded Organic Farming and Gardening magazine in 1942. Even in 1992, when Rodale first published Rodale's All-New Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening, we were just beginning to understand some of the global issues that are the topics of daily media reports today. We had heard about the threat of global warming, but many of us weren't paying attention yet. We didn't grasp the speed at which species could become extinct when their habitats were destroyed (or how quickly humans could destroy habitats). We were just figuring out that some popular garden plants, such as English ivy, could spread into woodlands and outcompete the wildflowers and other native plants. Gardeners in arid regions had begun worrying about water conservation, but overall, North American gardeners and homeowners were routinely lavishing water on their large, closely clipped lawns.<br><br>Here in 2009, nearly everyone has heard scientists reporting on--and politicians arguing about--the best way to respond to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and other large-scale problems related to climate change. Underlying these concerns, we're also wondering how the world's natural systems can cope with the world's ever-increasing population: less than 2.5 billion in 1942, about 5.4 billion in 1992, and 6.6 billion in 2008.<br><br>One response is an exciting and inspiring interest in "green living." People are seeking ways to reduce their "carbon footprint" (the total amount of greenhouse gases produced to support their lifestyle) in order to slow the rate of carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere. They're becoming more conscious of saving our precious clean water and more concerned about slowing the rate of habitat destruction and species extinction.<br><br>Green living can involve some tough decisions, such as cutting back on your driving to conserve gasoline and finding ways to use less electricity and fossil fuel in your home. For many of us, the easiest and best place to start living greener is in our gardens, where making environmentally friendly choices is often downright fun. For example, you'll discover the pleasure of growing some of your own food. You'll enjoy choosing and planting shrubs, trees, and groundcovers that help shelter and support wildlife, and you'll find that they'll accomplish other useful purposes as well, such as cooling your home in the summer and providing privacy as more homes and people crowd around you. You'll feel a sense of accomplishment when you plan and install a special garden to divert rainwater into the soil instead of into the polluting pathway of stormwater drainage systems. Maybe you'll even decide to plant a stand of fast-growing trees or bamboo to offset some of the carbon you produce in your day-to-day living.<br><br>Because organic gardeners have an attitude or philosophy based on respect or reverence for living things and natural systems, there's a natural link between traditional organic farming and gardening and a wish to grow and live "green": It's the knowledge that everything we do--in our gardens, our homes, our communities--has an impact on everything else. Every choice we make to use resources wisely, whether it's water, soil, organic matter (yard waste), paper goods, energy, even money, is part of our total impact on the environment around us.<br><br>In this chapter we'll cover many of these green issues and suggest steps you can take for more earth-friendly gardening. We don't have all the solutions, and we probably haven't even named all the problems yet. But as organic gardeners and environmentally concerned people have always done, we will do our best to take care of Nature and learn from the design of her natural systems.<br><br>PLANTING GREEN<br><br>Starting a backyard vegetable garden, choosing plants for a perennial garden, or planting a small grouping of trees and shrubs may not seem related to global climate change or environmental issues such as disappearing rainforests. But many scientists believe that home landscapes can be part of the solution to these complex problems. As the saying goes: If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.<br><br>For example, many gardeners who continue to use chemical pesticides do so because they think that the small amount they buy and use doesn't have any significant impact. But overall, U.S. gardeners spend more than $11 billion in just one year on pesticides. And acre for acre, home gardeners apply more pesticides to their lawns and gardens than U.S. farmers do on their fields. If every U.S. gardener decided to go organic, what an amazing difference that could make! And if every gardener decided to launch a green gardening effort as well, the impact could have exciting and world-changing potential.<br><br>As Local as It Gets<br><br>Choosing to buy and eat locally produced food is one of the best-publicized suggestions for helping to reduce our carbon footprint. The logic is easy to follow: Buying and eating spinach, lettuce, or tomatoes grown by a local farmer is a green choice because it saves the fossil fuel cost of shipping that produce from across the country (or across the world).<br><br>Shopping at a farmers' market or subscribing to a local CSA (community- supported agriculture) farm are great green choices, but the greenest choice of all is to start growing some of your own food. No matter where you live--city, suburbs, or country--your green gardening efforts should start with a vegetable garden or berry patch. Convert some of your lawn to a vegetable garden (which will also cut down on the need to use fossil fuel for mowing). If you don't have a lawn, grow veggies and small fruits in containers on your patio or deck. Urban gardeners can grow food crops on the rooftop or in a community garden. This encyclopedia is packed with information on growing vegetables, fruits, berries, and herbs organically. Choose something you love to eat, and get started!<br><br>Even if you need only a small garden to feed yourself, you don't need to stop your food gardening efforts there. Call a local food bank in your area and ask if it runs a program of collecting fresh seasonal produce. It's a satisfying and worthwhile way to combine your green gardening efforts with service to your community.<br><br>Habitat Gardening<br><br>In the United States, urban and suburban sprawl is the greatest cause of species endangerment and extinction because widespread, ill-planned development is destroying vital habitat for plants ranging from cacti and orchids to wildflowers and native trees and shrubs. And it's not just plants--habitat destruction is also creating problems for insects, birds, amphibians, and many other kinds of wildlife. Worldwide, up to 600,000 species have become extinct in just the past 50 years. Some projections warn that if this rate of habitat destruction continues, we could lose half of the earth's species by 2050.<br><br>The most threatened habitat in the world is tropical forestland, which makes up only 6 percent of the earth's land surface but is home to an estimated 50 to 90 percent of all species. Even though tropical forests are a long distance from your garden, you can notice one effect of their destruction in your own yard--fewer migratory songbirds. Many songbird species are in decline due to loss of their winter habitat in Central America and South America. So global loss is local loss, and in the long run, what we do locally has global impact as well.<br><br>The common theme of natural habitats in most regions is biodiversity. If you want to replicate natural landscapes and help with habitat, you will combine different kinds of plants that grow compatibly together and benefit birds, butterflies, and other animals. Most natural habitats include groups of trees and shrubs surrounded by perennials, including grasses and groundcovers. A successful habitat garden provides homes for creatures ranging from tiny parasitic wasps and fast-flying hummingbirds to toads, squirrels, and perhaps even a red fox.<br><br>Here's how to get started:<br><br>* Analyze your site to decide if it's most suited for a woodland, prairie, wetland, oceanside, or desert plant and animal community.<br><br>* Choose native trees and shrubs, or other site-appropriate species that benefit wildlife. Plants with berries are often the best choices. Include both evergreen and deciduous plants.<br><br>* Cluster the trees and shrubs in islands or wide borders and hedgerows around your property. Start with just one plant cluster, and work over time to create an entire landscape of naturalized plant groups.<br><br>* Cover the areas around the tree and shrub clusters with perennials and grasses. Choose plants that spread (without becoming weeds). Use annuals to fill in while the groundcovers are spreading. Remember diversity--plant a variety of species.<br><br>* Encourage pollinators and other beneficial insects by choosing many kinds of flowers to provide pollen and nectar. Select flowers that bloom at different times from spring through fall, as well as some that offer generous seed heads toward autumn.<br><br>* Provide water in as many ways as possible--birdbaths, fountains, streams, water gardens, and dishes of water or shallow pools at the soil level. All creatures need water, and birds are drawn to the sounds of water splashing or dripping. Be sure you arrange to keep the water available in the heat of summer and all through the winter as well, since your habitat will be a year-round home for many species.<br><br>* Allow plants to grow naturally. While it's appropriate to prune out the occasional diseased or rubbing branches, a natural landscape is not the place for sheared shrubs. Contrary to classic pruning advice, a few crowding, overlapping, and touching branches on trees and shrubs is natural and desirable. The goal is to provide shelter and safety for many creatures.<br><br>* Tolerate the litter. In nature, leaves, fruit, and needles fall, cover the ground, and eventually decompose, adding organic matter and nutrients to the soil. Let that happen. (The exception here is diseased or pest- infested litter, which you should destroy rather than leaving in place.)<br><br>* Allow some logs to lie and snags (dead trees) to stand. Dying or dead trees or shrubs provide food and homes for many kinds of creatures and are part of a natural system. Where you can tolerate an untidy look, leave them in place--a pileated woodpecker showing up for an appetizer may be your reward!<br><br>* Make a brush pile. Perhaps the back of your property is suitable for brush piles. Especially if they are built upon large logs or rocks (so small animals or ground birds can scurry under), brush piles provide dining, safety, or places to raise a family.<br><br>* Consider the animals you do not welcome. That could mean deer--if so, avoid plants they prefer and choose those they rarely eat. If you are worried about rats, be sure your birdfeeders have catch trays so seed will be less likely to drop on the ground. Embracing diversity doesn't mean you give up all control over the territory; you just have to be smarter than a rat! You may need repellants, barriers, or fences, for specific reasons. True ecological balance is difficult to achieve, especially because your little habitat lies within an imbalanced world. But in most cases naturalized landscapes present few problems with pests of any kind.<br><br>Neighborhood Wildlife Corridors<br><br>When large tracts of natural habitat are broken up by development, roads, or even farms, it creates big problems for many species of wildlife.<br><br>Too small for comfort. Many wild creatures, such as the lovely wood thrush, can thrive only deep within large tracts of woodland. When those interior areas are reduced, populations of these woodland species decline.<br><br>Too much edge. Some predatory species that are not so desirable--crows, for example--thrive when there's lots of edge. (Edge is the boundary between two types of habitat, for example, woodland and open areas such as the cut- grass borders along a roadway.) As buildings, roads, and parking lots break up woods or meadows, the more vulnerable many species become to predators. (The incidence of road kills increases, too.)<br><br>Not enough connections. When appropriate habitat occurs only in isolated "islands," migratory mammals or birds may not be able to migrate successfully. This can lead to inbreeding and an imbalance in predator/prey relationships. Both situations produce weaker populations or eventual death.<br><br>Openings for invasive species. The more the plant life or soil of a natural area is disturbed (by digging, brush hogging, bulldozing, etc.), the more likely aggressive plant species are to invade. Purple loosestrife and giant hogweed colonize roadside ditches; Japanese honeysuckle and multiflora rose thrive where meadows have been cleared.<br><br>What You Can Do<br><br>Creating wildlife corridors is one way to counteract habitat loss in your area. These corridors allow wildlife to move from one large tract of habitat--such as a park, wildlife sanctuary, or undeveloped private land-- to another. They include culverts or overpasses when necessary so that animals can cross highways. Habitat biologists recommend that these corridors between major habitats should be at least 1,000 feet wide to accommodate many species. If you're lucky enough to live next to one of these existing wildlife corridors, you can be part of the solution by keeping your yard as natural as possible, preventing cats and dogs from roaming free, removing invasive plant species, and minimizing light pollution.<br><br>If you don't live next to a large-scale wildlife corridor, you can work together with your neighbors or local government to provide a smaller-scale sanctuary or corridor, which can still provide excellent habitat for wild creatures such as foxes and can encourage migrating songbirds. Imagine if everybody living along your street gave a 20- or 50-foot strip back to nature, and all those strips connected (some with water features too). That's a neighborhood wildlife corridor!<br><br>Another option is to lobby your local government offices to create a wildlife corridor or park. Start by finding out whether your community has a plan for providing "green space" and what it entails. Then, talk with local leaders and residents to help them understand that "green space" such as athletic fields and biking trails is not the same as wildlife habitat. By spreading the word, you may help convince local officials to set aside some "green space" as the kind of undeveloped natural area that will help preserve and encourage native plants and wildlife.<br><br>For more information about and plant choices for habitat gardens, see the Birds, Water Gardens, and Wildlife Gardening entries.<br><br>Pollinator Gardens<br><br>Even if your yard seems too small or too urban to provide much wildlife habitat, you can help to encourage a crucial wildlife population: native pollinators. With honeybees in ever more danger from disease, parasites, and threats like colony collapse disorder, our native bees are more crucial than ever to our food supply and to all plants that need insect pollination in order to reproduce.<br><br>Here's how to attract and nurture pollinators wherever you live:<br><br>Offer a flower buffet. Bees need nectar for energy and protein-rich pollen to raise their young. Plant a variety of flower types and colors. Favorite colors of pollinators include blue, purple, violet, white, and yellow. Plant annuals and perennials--some bee families prefer one over the other. Include native wildflowers, because they may be more attractive to pollinators than exotics. Observe your flowers, and plant more of whatever the bees seem to like b...</p><h2>Preacher&#39;s Pursuit (The First Mountain Man)</h2><p><b>Dreams Of Gold And Power</b><br><br> The mountains are brimming with the lure of fortunes--from gold to a booming fur trade.

This handsome volume presents brand-new photographs of and lucid critical commentary on 38 of Wright's most significant buildings, including such famous public structures as the Unity Temple (1905) in Oak Park, Illinois, and New York's Guggenheim Museum (1943-59), as well as lesser-known but stunning private homes. This selection embraces Wright's entire career, from the early prairie style to the adventurous creations of the 1940s and 1950s. The process of design for each masterwork is documented from Wright's earliest conceptual sketches to his polished drawings, which are works of art in their own right. Some black-and-white photographs of buildings under construction are provided, but the book's strongest visual components are the grand color photographs. The shots were composed to capture the unique aesthetic of each structure's exterior and interior, from its orientation to the land to its elegant decorative detail and dramatic use of natural light. A liberal sampling of excerpts from Wright's writings and correspondence adds to this volume's authority and value. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>How to Do Ecology: A Concise Handbook</h2><p><p>Most ecology books and courses focus on the facts and the concepts. While these are essential, many young ecologists need to figure out how to actually do research themselves. <i>How to Do Ecology</i> provides nuts-and-bolts advice on how to develop a successful thesis and research program. This book presents different approaches to posing testable ecological questions. In particular, it covers the uses, strengths, and limitations of manipulative experiments in ecology. It will help young ecologists consider meaningful treatments, controls, replication, independence, and randomization in experiments, as well as where to do experiments and how to organize a season of work. This book also presents strategies for analyzing natural patterns, the value of alternative hypotheses, and what to do with negative results.</p><p>Science is only part of being a successful ecologist. This engagingly written book offers students advice on working with other people and navigating their way through the land mines of research. Findings that don't get communicated are of little value. <i>How to Do Ecology</i> suggests effective ways to communicate information in the form of journal articles, oral presentations, and posters. Finally, it outlines strategies for developing successful grant and research proposals. Numerous checklists, figures, and boxes throughout the book summarize and reinforce the main points. In short, this book makes explicit many of the unspoken assumptions behind doing good research in ecology, and provides an invaluable resource for meaningful conversations among ecologists.</p></p><p><p>"Almost all graduate students in ecology will take away something valuable from reading <i>How to Do Ecology</i>. Karban and Huntzinger cover a wide range of topics: how to formulate research questions, why to get a field notebook and what to put in it, how and why to incorporate observations, experiments, and models in your dissertation, how to give a seminar on your work and get your results published. Reading this book feels like having a good talk during a long walk in the woods with a wise and experienced advisor who really has the time to distill and share years of thinking about how ecological research works. Get it, and keep it handy, and your work will be the richer and more successful for it."--<b>Jessica Gurevitch, Stony Brook University</b></p><p>"<i>How to Do Ecology</i> may save years of grief and buckets of sweat for ecologists at the beginning of their careers.

He began inventing these stories in his American wife&#39;s hometown of Brattleboro, Vermont, to amuse his eldest daughter--and they have served ever since as a source of laughter for children everywhere.</p><p>How did the camel get his hump? Why won&#39;t cats do as they are told? Who invented reading and writing? How did an inquisitive little elephant change the lives of elephants everywhere? Kipling&#39;s imagined answers to such questions draw on the beast fables he heard as a child in India, as well as on folk games with language, exploring the relationships between thought, speech, and the written word. He also celebrates his own joy in fatherhood. The tales were told to his own and his friends&#39; children over many years before he wrote them down, adding poems and his own illustrations. They invite older and younger readers to share a magical experience, each contributing to the other&#39;s pleasure, but each can also enjoy them alone, as more jokes, subtexts, and exotic references emerge with every reading. This fully illustrated edition includes two extra stories and Kipling&#39;s own explanation of the title.Rudyard Joseph Kipling was born in the then named Bombay, India on 30th December 1865. Aged six, he was sent to England to be educated, firstly in Southsea, where he was cared for in a foster home, and later at Westward Ho, a United Services College in Devon. A life of misery at the former was described in his story 'Baa Baa Black Sheep', whilst Westward Ho was used as a basis for his questioning the public school ethic in 'Stalky and Co'. Kipling returned to India in 1882 to work as an assistant editor for the Civil and Military Gazette of Lahore. His reputation as a writer was established with stories of English life in India, published there in 1888/9. &#x2018;The Phantom Rickshaw&#x2019;, &#x2018;Soldiers Three&#x2019; and &#x2018;Under the Deodars&#x2019; are amongst these early works. Returning to England in 1889, Kipling settled in London and continued to earn a living as a writer. In 1892 he married Caroline Balestier, an American. They travelled extensively in the following four years, including a spell living in America, and it was in this time most of his enduring work was written, not least &#x2018;The Jungle Book&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Second Jungle Book&#x2019;. Kipling once again returned to England in 1896 and continued his writing career, although tragedy hit the family when his eldest daughter, Josephine, died in 1899. Nonetheless, in 1901 he completed &#x2018;Kim&#x2019;, often considered to be his best work. The following year, having settled in Sussex, he published &#x2018;Just So Stories&#x2019;, a book he had planned to write for Josephine. Having refused the position of Poet Laureate, which was offered in 1895, he did accept the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming the first English author to be so honoured. By 1910, however, Kipling&#x2019;s appeal was waning. His poems and stories were based on values that were perceived as outdated. There was widespread reaction against Victorian imperialism, highlighted by the incompetent management of the Boer War. When World War I came, Kipling had difficulty in adapting to the mood of the public and after his only son, John, was reported missing in action believed killed in 1915, he became very active on the War Graves Commission. After the war he became an increasingly isolated figure, although some of his best writing was to come, with &#x2018;Debits and Credits&#x2019; in 1926 and &#x2018;Limits and Renewals&#x2019; in 1932. Kipling died in 1936 in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Today, however, he is once again avidly read not just for the quality of his writing and storytelling, but through a renewed interest in the behaviour and values he represented.</p><h2>Too Close to Home (Women of Justice Series #1)</h2><p>Samantha Cash is the FBI's secret weapon.

Allen</b> is one of America's most famous and most influential financial advisers of all time. After graduating with an MBA from Brigham Young University in 1974, Allen began making small real-estate investments, transforming his tiny nest egg into a large, multimillion-dollar net worth in a few short years. He shared his powerful system with the public in the #1 national bestseller <i>Nothing Down</i>, with forty-six weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> national bestseller list. He followed that success with <i>Creating Wealth</i>, with well over three quarters of a million copies in print. His other major bestsellers include <i>Multiple Streams of Income</i> and <i>The One-Minute Millionaire</i>. For over twenty years, Robert Allen has been successfully sharing his wealth-building techniques in popular seminars throughout the fifty states and Canada. A popular television and radio guest, he has appeared on hundreds of programs, including <i>Good Morning America</i> and <i>Larry King Live</i>. He has also been featured in such national publications as <i>The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, Barron's, Money</i> magazine, and <i>Reader's Digest</i>.INTRODUCTION<br><br><b>Second Chance</b><br><br>Thank you for reading the latest edition of <i>Nothing Down.</i> I was thirty-one years old when Simon &amp; Schuster published the first edition of <i>Nothing Down.</i> Little did I know at the time that it would go on to become the all-time bestselling real estate investment book. It has sold well over a million copies and helped untold thousands buy their first home or investment property...and for hundreds, perhaps even thousands, earn their first million. (If you're one of those, please go to www.millionairehalloffame.com and log in your success story.) Although I've updated the book to reflect current laws and tactics, the principles in this book are timeless. The following phrase is still as true:<br><br>Don't wait to buy real estate. Buy real estate and wait.<br><br>Real estate is the simplest, easiest, safest, shortest route to financial freedom. This is also as true today as it will be twenty-five years from now. If you want financial freedom, real estate will be a large part of your portfolio.<br><br>Although these principles are timeless, you and I are not. If you'll indulge me, just before you launch into this book, let me tell you about a lesson I learned recently that has caused me to be even more intent on getting this timeless message out to as many people as possible.<br><br>Time moves rapidly for all of us. For me, it almost came to a dead stop on March 15, 2003. On that day I was driving home after giving a speech to about a thousand beginning real estate investors at the Anaheim Convention Center (near Disneyland). It was a very rainy night and there were numerous accidents on Southern California's freeways that evening. At about nine P.M., just north of San Diego, my Lexus skidded off the freeway at full speed and smashed directly into a large tree. Miraculously, another motorist witnessed everything and called 911. It took the rescue crew over half an hour to extract me from the wreckage using the "jaws of life."<br><br>I was transported to the Scripps Trauma center in La Jolla where I spent six days in intensive care with my multiple injuries. Even though the airbags had deployed, I broke my left wrist, blew out a quadracep tendon in my right knee, had my scalp peeled back (probably by the rearview mirror) leaving a nasty scar on my forehead, suffered cracked vertebrae, a broken big toe, multiple bruises, cuts, and a serious concussion. They tell me that amnesia is common for someone who has had a close encounter with a tree at high speed. Mercifully, I have no recollection of the accident, the ambulance ride, the operations, and most of the first three days of the hospital stay.<br><br>In addition to the physical trauma, there were emotional issues to deal with. What goes through your mind when you realize that you were seconds away from death? It's all pretty heavy stuff. I have come through all of this and am healing nicely both physically, spiritually, and emotionally, although I'll probably have lingering pains and limps and other issues to deal with for the rest of my life.<br><br>So why bring all of this up at the beginning of a book on real estate?<br><br>When I look at the photos of my demolished car, I wonder how I could have escaped alive...or more important, why I was able to escape alive. (After serious consideration, I've decided to post the photos of my crashed car at www.robertallenrealestate.com.)<br><br>I feel as if this has given me a new lease on life -- my second chance. The "old" Bob was too focused on unimportant things. The "new" Bob is more connected to heart and soul and love and people. I have so much love for Daryl, my amazing wife of twenty-six years, as she stood by me through such a frightening ordeal. When I became fully conscious again, it was wonderful to see my two older children, Aimee and Aaron, standing at the foot of my hospital bed, and then to receive a phone call from my youngest son, Hunter, who was at the time serving as a missionary in Brazil. I have so much love and respect for my business partners and associates for letting me take this extra time for "research." Thanks a million.<br><br>Finally, I thank God for this "accidental" wake-up call. I wouldn't wish the same experience on anyone else, but I pray that each of us can wake up to the new life that is possible -- to leave behind the parts of our old selves that don't serve us and embrace the attitudes and feelings that lead to a new life and a brighter future.<br><br>I hope that you allow this book to be your mentor to a new life. As you read this book, I hope you'll be inspired to believe that you, too, deserve a second chance -- a life of financial freedom and prosperity. I hope you'll read this book and be empowered to learn techniques and strategies that will move you more quickly toward what you want. I hope you'll find yourself saying, "I can do this."<br><br>I've intentionally written <i>Nothing Down</i> in layman's terms (because that's who I was when I made my first million). Yes, you can find more technical investment books -- and I encourage you to read them -- but this book is designed to reach the part of you that has always known you were destined to be financially successful. There is so much you can accomplish in life, you don't have to be held back by a lack of finances. Besides, real estate investing can be a lot of fun (mixed with a modicum of frustration to keep you humble).<br><br>The mere fact that you picked up this book tells me that you are blessed (or perhaps afflicted) with an entrepreneurial spirit. While in Hawaii a few years ago, as I sat at the breakfast table on the outdoor patio, a swarm of little tropical birds flitted anxiously around my table chirping and begging me to share some of the crumbs from my breakfast muffin. I flicked a few crumbs off the table and they attacked the crumbs as a flock. I wondered if there was an entrepreneurial bird among them, so I placed a large chunk of juicy muffin on the edge of my table. The flock flitted about, chirping and screeching, but not one dared land to enjoy the moist morsel. For several minutes nothing happened, and then finally one of them landed on the farthest edge of my table. He glanced out of one eye at me...very leery, skeptical, skittish...and out of the other eye at the prized muffin. He moved his way, ever so carefully, toward the muffin and finally began to pick at it, retreating from time to time to enjoy his luscious treat and then returning for more. And then he did something unexpected. He purposefully dragged the muffin off the table so the other birds could enjoy it. This was apparently an enlightened bird, willing to share his plenty with his feathered friends.<br><br>I hope you will become like that little bird, and dare to do things the other birds won't do. If you do, you will eat well all of your days. Just remember to share some of your well-deserved excess. Moreover, teach other birds how to do the same. There's plenty for all of us...if we're just courageous enough to go get it.<br><br>As long as I continue to breathe, I'll continue to teach as many people as I can that we are all destined for greatness. Regardless of what other people may have told you, I know you can become financially successful.<br><br>I wish you well. I hope that someday we can meet and that you can tell me, "You know that little bird? Well, that's me."<br><br>Have a great life.<br><br>Copyright � 1980, 1984, 1990, 2004 by Robert G.

Herb McCormack, editor-at-large, Cruising World Lin and Larry Pardey have been called the enablers. Their books and videos have encouraged sailors of all ages to stop dreaming and start doing. The knowledge they share has been earned during the more than four decades they have been voyaging together, years during which they completed both east-about and west-about circumnavigations on board their own self-built, engine-free cutters, Seraffyn and Taleisin. During their most recent east-to-west voyage, they sailed below four of the great Southern Capes, including Cape Horn. An avid racing sailor from the age of 17, Larry worked as first mate on the 140-ton, 85-foot schooner Double Eagle, voyaging on her to Hawaii and along the coast of Mexico before meeting Lin. Larry, along with Leslie Dyball, won first on handicap in the exceptionally stormy 1974 Round Britain two-handed race. Lin and Larry have delivered more than two dozen boats across oceans and raced on their own and others boats. To date, Lin has sailed almost 185,000 miles and Larry has accumulated more than 200,000 miles at sea. In 1996, Larry received the International Oceanic Award from the Royal Institute of Navigation, presented by the Princess Royal, Princess Anne, for meritorious voyaging using traditional navigation methods. During the same year, Lin received the Ocean Cruising Award for being the person who has done the most to foster and encourage ocean cruising in small craft and the practice of seamanship and navigation in all branches. In 2000, both were inducted into the Cruising World Hall of Fame. Lin and Larry s articles have appeared in Cruising World, Sail, Good Old Boat, Wooden Boat, Practical Sailor, Yachting World, Yachting Monthly, Classic Boat (UK), Cruising Helmsman (Australia), Boating New Zealand, South African Yachting, Nautica Brazil, and Yacht (Germany). Their books and video programs have been published in the United States, England, and New Zealand; three have been translated into German and Japanese. Lin and Larry are cruising on board Taleisin and during the Southern Hemisphere summers, they often return to New Zealand, where they cruise and race on their 113-year-old classic gaff-rigged cutter, Thelma.</p><h2>The China Governess</h2><p>Adopted heir Timothy Kinnit hires Albert Campion to investigate his parentage before he will marry his beloved Julia, but Campion&#39;s snooping turns up a murderous old scandal that threatens to escalate into a present-day bloodbath</p><p><p>Margery Allingham was born in Ealing, London in 1904 to a family immersed in literature. Her first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923 when she was 19. Her first work of detective fiction was a serialized story published by the Daily Express in 1927. Entitled The White Cottage Mystery, it contained atypical themes for a woman writer of the era. Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, albeit originally as a minor character. He returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, much taken with the character. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and over 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.</p>&#34;Margery Allingham has worked her way up to a worthy place among the tiny hierarchy of front-rankers in the detective world&#34; * Tatler * &#34;One of the finest &#39;golden age&#39; crime novelists&#34; * Sunday Telegraph * &#34;Faultless&#34; * The Times * &#34;Allingham captures her quintessential quiet detective Albert Campion to perfection...

Like so many tormented souls before her, the girl&#39;s mother is inevitably drawn to Charlie Parker&#39;s doorstep desperate for redemption and revenge. Despite the danger that his chosen profession imposes on his wife and newborn daughter, Parker knows that the woman and her troubles cannot be ignored. As always, he is driven as much by the evil that simmers in the hidden honeycomb world as he is by the ties of friendship and blood. As Parker gets closer to the girl&#39;s captors, he discovers that her disappearance is linked to a church of bones in Eastern Europe, to the slaughter at a French monastery in 1944, and to the myth of an object known as the Black Angel -- an object considered by evil men to be beyond priceless. But the Black Angel is not a legend. It is real. It lives. It dreams. And the mystery of its existence may contain the secret of Parker&#39;s own origins.</p><p>John Connolly is the author of the Charlie Parker series of mystery novels, the supernatural collection <i>Nocturnes,</i> the Samuel Johnson Trilogy for younger readers, and (with Jennifer Ridyard) the Chronicles of the Invaders series.

The angels screamed in their torment, and their burning brought brightness to the shadows for the first time. The lowest of them cowered in the depths, and there they created their own world in which to dwell.<br> <br>As the last angel fell, he looked to heaven and saw all that was to be denied him for eternity, and the vision was so terrible to him that it burned itself upon his eyes. And so, as the skies closed above him, it was given to him to witness the face of God disappear among gray clouds, and the beauty and sorrow of the image was imprinted forever in his memory, and upon his sight. He was cursed to walk forever as an outcast, shunned even by his own kind, for what could be more agonizing for them than to see, each time they looked in his eyes, the ghost of God flickering in the blackness of his pupils?<br> <br>And so alone was he that he tore himself in two, that he might have company in his long exile, and together these twin parts of the same being wandered the still-forming earth. In time, they were joined by a handful of the fallen who were weary of cowering in that bleak kingdom of their own creation. After all, what is hell but the eternal absence of God? To exist in a hellish state is to be denied forever the promise of hope, of redemption, of love. To those who have been forsaken, hell has no geography.<br> <br>But these angels at last grew weary of roaming throughout the desolate world without an outlet for their rage and their despair. They found a deep, dark place in which to sleep, and there they secreted themselves away and waited. And after many years, mines were dug, and tunnels lit, and the deepest and greatest of these excavations was among the Bohemian silver mines at Kutn� Hora, and it was called Kank.<br> <br>And it was said that when the mine reached its final depth, the lights carried by the miners flickered as though troubled by a breeze where no breeze could exist, and a great sighing was heard, as of souls released from their bondage. A stench of burning arose, and tunnels collapsed, trapping and killing those beneath. A storm of filth and dirt emerged, sweeping through the mine, choking and blinding all in its path. Those who survived spoke of voices in the abyss, and the beating of wings in the midst of the clouds. The storm ascended toward the main shaft, bursting forth into the night sky, and the men who saw it glimpsed a redness at its heart, as though it were all aflame.<br> <br>And the rebel angels took upon themselves the appearance of men, and set about creating a kingdom that they might rule through stealth and the corrupted will of others. They were led by the twin demons, the greatest of their number, the Black Angels. The first, called Ashmael, immersed himself in the fires of battle, and whispered empty promises of glory into the ears of ambitious rulers. The other, called Immael, waged his own war upon the church and its leaders, the representatives upon the earth of the One who had banished his brother. He gloried in fire and rape, and his shadow fell upon the sacking of monasteries and the burning of chapels. Each half of this twin being bore the mark of God as a white mote in his eye, Ashmael in his right eye and Immael in his left.<br> <br>But in his arrogance and wrath, Immael allowed himself to be glimpsed for a moment in his true, blighted form. He was confronted by a Cistercian monk named Erdric from the monastery at Sedlec, and they fought above vats of molten silver in a great foundry. At last, Immael was cast down, caught in the moment of transformation from human to Other, and he fell into the hot ore. Erdric called for the metal to be slowly cooled, and Immael was trapped in silver, powerless to free himself from this purest of prisons.<br> <br>And Ashmael felt his pain, and sought to free him, but the monks hid Immael well, and kept him from those who would release him from his bonds. Yet Ashmael never stopped seeking his brother, and in time he was joined in his search by those who shared his nature, and by men corrupted by his promises. They marked themselves so that they might be known to one another, and their mark was a grapnel, a forked hook, for in the old lore this was the first weapon of the fallen angels.<br> <br>And they called themselves &#x201c;Believers.&#x201d;|The Black Angel CHAPTER<p></p> I<p></p> <br>The woman stepped carefully from the Greyhound bus, her right hand holding firmly on to the bar as she eased herself down. A relieved sigh escaped from her lips once both feet were on level ground, the relief that she always felt when a simple task was negotiated without incident. She was not old&#x2014;she was barely into her fifties&#x2014;but she looked, and felt, much older. She had endured a great deal, and accumulated sorrows had intensified the predations of the years. Her hair was silver-gray, and she had long since ceased making the monthly trek to the salon to have its color altered. There were horizontal lines stretching from the corner of each eye, like healed wounds, paralleled by similar lines on her forehead. She knew how she had come by them, for occasionally she caught herself wincing as if in pain while she looked in the mirror or saw herself reflected in the window of a store, and the depth of those lines increased with the transformation in her expression. It was always the same thoughts, the same memories, that caused the change, and always the same faces that she recalled: the boy, now a man; her daughter, as she once was and as she now might be; and the one who had made her little girl upon her, his face sometimes contorted, as it was at the moment of her daughter&#x2019;s conception, and at other times tattered and destroyed, as it was before they closed the coffin lid upon him, erasing at last his physical presence from the world.<br> <br>Nothing, she had come to realize, will age a woman faster than a troubled child. In recent years, she had become prone to the kind of accidents that bedeviled the lives of women two or three decades older than she, and took longer to recover from them than once she had. It was the little things that she had to look out for: unanticipated curbs, neglected cracks in the sidewalk, the unexpected jolting of a bus as she rose from her seat, the forgotten water spilled upon the kitchen floor. She feared these things more than she feared the young men who congregated in the parking lot of the strip mall near her home, watching for the vulnerable, for those whom they considered easy prey. She knew that she would never be one of their victims, as they were more afraid of her than they were of the police, or of their more vicious peers, for they knew of the man who waited in the shadows of her life. A small part of her hated the fact that they feared her, even as she enjoyed the protection that it brought. Her protection was hard bought, purchased, she believed, with the loss of a soul.<br> <br>She prayed for him, sometimes. While the others wailed &#x201c;Hallelujah&#x201d; to the preacher, beating their breasts and shaking their heads, she remained silent, her chin to her chest, and pleaded softly. In the past, a long time ago, she would ask the Lord that her nephew might turn again to His radiant light and embrace the salvation that lay only in relinquishing violent ways. Now she no longer wished for miracles. Instead, as she thought about him, she begged God that, when this lost sheep at last stood before Him for the final judgment, He would be merciful and forgive him his trespasses; that He would look closely at the life he had lived and find within it those little acts of decency that might enable Him to offer succor to this sinner.<br> <br>But perhaps there were some lives that could never be redeemed, and some sins so terrible that they were beyond forgiveness. The preacher said that the Lord forgives all, but only if the sinner truly acknowledges his fault and seeks another path. If this was true, then she feared that her prayers would count for nothing, and he was damned to eternity.<br> <br>She showed her ticket to the man unloading the baggage from the bus. He was gruff and unfriendly to her, but he appeared to be that way to everyone. Young men and women hovered watchfully at the periphery of the light from the bus&#x2019;s windows, like wild animals fearful of the fire yet hungry for those who lay within the circle of its warmth. Her handbag gripped to her chest, she took her case by its handle and wheeled it toward the escalator. She watched those around her, heedful of the warnings of her neighbors back home.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t accept no offers of help. Don&#x2019;t be talking to nobody seems like he just offerin&#x2019; to assist a lady with her bag, don&#x2019;t matter how well he dressed or how sweetly he sings. . . .<br> <br>But there were no offers of help, and she ascended without incident to the busy streets of this alien city, as foreign to her as Cairo or Rome might have been, dirty and crowded and unforgiving. She had scribbled an address on a piece of paper, along with the directions she had painstakingly transcribed over the phone from the man at the hotel, hearing the impatience in his voice as he was forced to repeat the address, the name of the hotel near incomprehensible to her when spoken in his thick immigrant accent.<br> <br>She walked the streets, pulling her bag behind her. She carefully noted the numbers at the intersections, trying to take as few turns as possible, until she came to the big police building. There she waited for another hour, until at last a policeman came to talk to her. He had a thin file in front of him, but she could add nothing to what she had told him over the phone, and he could tell her only that they were doing what they could. Still, she filled out more papers, in the hope that some small detail she provided might lead them to her daughter, then left and hailed a cab on the street. She passed the piece of paper with the address of her hotel through a small hole in the Plexiglas screen. She asked the driver how much it would cost to go there, and he shrugged. He was an Asian man, and he did not look pleased to see the scribbled destination.<br> <br>&#x201c;Traffic. Who knows?&#x201d;<br> <br>He waved a hand at the slow-moving streams of cars and trucks and buses. Horns honked loudly, and drivers shouted angrily at one another. All was impatience and frustration, overshadowed by buildings that were too high, out of scale with those who were expected to live and work inside and outside them. She could not understand how anyone would choose to remain in such a place.<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty, maybe,&#x201d; said the cabdriver.<br> <br>She hoped it would be less than twenty. Twenty dollars was a lot, and she did not know how long she would have to stay here. She had booked the hotel room for three days, and had sufficient funds to cover another three days after that, as long as she ate cheaply and could master the intricacies of the subway. She had read about it, but had never seen it in reality and had no concept of its operations. She knew only that she did not like the thought of descending beneath the earth, into the darkness, but she could not afford to take cabs all the time. Buses might be better. At least they stayed aboveground, slowly though they seemed to move in this city.<br> <br>He might offer her money, of course, once she found him, but she would refuse any such offer, just as she had always refused it, carefully returning the checks that he sent to the only contact address that she had for him. His money was tainted, just as he was tainted, but she needed his help now: not his money, but his knowledge. Something terrible had happened to her daughter, of that she was certain, even if she could not explain how she knew.<br> <br>Alice, oh Alice, why did you have to come to this place?<br> <br>Her own mother had been blessed, or cursed, with the gift. She knew when someone was suffering, and could sense when harm had come to anyone who was dear to her. The dead talked to her. They told her things. Her life was filled with whispers. The gift had not been passed on, and for that the woman was grateful, but she wondered sometimes if a faint trace of it had not found its way into her, a mere spark of the great power that had dwelt in her mother. Or perhaps all mothers were cursed with the ability to sense their children&#x2019;s deepest sufferings, even when they were far, far from them. All that she could say for sure was that she had not known a moment&#x2019;s peace in recent days, and that she heard her daughter&#x2019;s voice calling to her when sleep fleetingly came.<br> <br>She would tell that to him when she met him, in the hope that he would understand. Even if he did not, she knew that he would help, for the girl was blood to him.<br> <br>And if there is one thing that he understood, it was blood.<br> <br>I PARKED IN AN alleyway about fifty feet from the house, then covered the rest of the distance on foot. I could see Jackie Garner hunched behind the wall bordering the property. He wore a black wool hat, a black jacket, and black jeans. His hands were uncovered, and his breath formed phantoms in the air. Beneath his jacket I made out the word SYLVIA written on his T-shirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;New girlfriend?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Jackie pulled open his jacket so I could see the T-shirt more clearly. It read, TIM &#x2018;THE MAINE-IAC&#x2019; SYLVIA, a reference to one of our local-boys-made-good, and featured a poor caricature of the great man himself. In September 2002, Tim Sylvia, all six-eight and 260 pounds of him, became the first Mainer to compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, eventually going on to take the Heavyweight Championship title in Las Vegas in 2003, knocking down the undefeated champion, Ricco Rodriguez, with a right cross in the first round. &#x201c;I hit him hahd,&#x201d; Sylvia told a postmatch interviewer, making every Down-Easter with flattened vowel sounds feel instantly proud. Unfortunately, Sylvia tested positive for anabolic steroids after his first defense, against the six-eleven Gan &#x201c;The Giant&#x201d; McGee, and voluntarily surrendered his belt and title. I remembered Jackie telling me once that he&#x2019;d attended the fight. Some of McGee&#x2019;s blood had landed on his jeans, and he now saved them for special wear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got a friend who makes them. I can let you have some cheap.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t take them any other way. In fact, I wouldn&#x2019;t take them at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackie was offended. For a guy who might have passed for Tim Sylvia&#x2019;s out-of-condition older brother, he was pretty sensitive.<br> <br>&#x201c;How many are there in the house?&#x201d; I asked, but his attention had already wandered on to another subject.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, we&#x2019;re dressed the same,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re dressed the same. Look: you got the hat, the same jacket, the jeans. Except you got gloves and I got this T-shirt, we could be twins.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackie Garner was a good guy, but I thought that he might be a little crazy. Someone once told me that a shell accidentally went off close to him when he was serving with the U.S. Army in Berlin just before the Wall came down. He was unconscious for a week, and for six months after he awoke he couldn&#x2019;t remember anything that happened later than 1983. Even though he was mostly recovered, there were still gaps in his memory, and he occasionally confused the guys at Bull Moose Music by asking for &#x201c;new&#x201d; CDs that were actually fifteen years old.

But when an accident leaves his mansion in ruins, Ape will have to decide what's truly important... his old house or his new friends.</p><p>Dick King-Smith lives in Bristol, England.Grade 4-6-Archibald Peregrine Edmund Spring-Russell, otherwise known as Ape, is fed up. For years, he's been ignored by his children and bullied by his disagreeable wife. Penny Royal, his ancestral mansion, is about as homey as your typical museum. Now his family has cleared out and he's left alone with 15 empty bedrooms. Ape promptly moves into the kitchen and contemplates buying a pet. Soon there are hens laying eggs in the living room, rabbits and guinea pigs in the dining room, canaries in the music room, and, thanks to some traveling gypsies, a donkey in the garden. Ape soon discovers that he needs help taking care of all of these animals. The two gypsies, Joe Hart and his son, Jake, offer their services, and before he knows it, the elderly man has another family, this one much more to his liking. When Penny Royal accidentally burns to the ground and the Harts are blamed, Ape is forced to decide whether to stay where his ancestors put him or follow his new family to their next stopping place. King-Smith explores several themes in this warm story: prejudice, acceptance, family life, and, above all, the need to be yourself. The soft pencil sketches lend depth to the narrative and bring the characters to life. Peppered with good advice on how to care for and about pets, this book is a winner.<br><i>Linda Bindner, Athens Clarke County Library, GA</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Reading with God: Lectio Divina</h2><p><p>David Foster is a Benedictine Monk of Downside Abbey and chaplain to Downside School. He has always been concerned to bring the riches of the monastic tradition to lay people as they struggle to live the Christian life in the modern world. Lectio Divina or the art of spiritual reading is an art which is all but lost outside monastic communities. But following St Benedict's opening command in his Rule to 'listen', attending to the word of God through the printed text is an art which needs to be rediscovered in a world in which we are surrounded by a cacophony of sound and noise.

Beautifully designed, this intimate, album-sized collection of photographs, printed in rich duotones and evocative color, captures the optimism and experimentation, the styles, the flirtatiousness and the freedoms taken--all from an insider&#39;s point of view.

Out in the surf, down on the sand, aboard somebody&#39;s boat, dancing around a campfire, back-flipping off the lifeguard stand, collecting lobster, drinking at the bar and generally wearing as little as possible, here are the regulars of the southern California beach scene, un-self-conscious and perpetually glamorous, alongside loving portraits of the beach and the ocean themselves.</p><p></p><h2>An Introduction to Canon Law (Revised)</h2><p>Canon law is the name given to the rules that govern church order and discipline of the Roman Catholic Church.

Or does it begin long before, when a child swallows more pain than love and is forever changed? </p><p> Perhaps it doesn't matter. </p><p> Or perhaps it matters more than everything else. </p><p> We judge and punish based on facts, but facts are not truth. Facts are like a buried skeleton uncovered long after death. Truth is fluid. Truth is alive. To know the truth requires understanding, the most difficult human art. It requires seeing all things at once, forward and backward, the way God sees. </p><p> <i>Forward and backward...</i> </p><p> So we begin in the middle, with a telephone ringing in a dark bedroom on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain in New Orleans, Louisiana. There's a woman lying on the bed, mouth open in the mindless gape of sleep. She seems not to hear the phone. Then suddenly the harsh ring breaks through, like defibrillator paddles shocking a comatose patient. The woman's hand shoots from beneath the covers, groping for the phone, not finding it. She gasps and rises onto one elbow. Then she groans and picks up the receiver from the bedside table. </p><p> The woman is me. </p><p> "Dr. Ferry," I croak. </p><p> "Are you sleeping?" The voice is male, taut with anger. </p><p> "No." My denial is automatic, but my mouth is dry as a cotton ball, and my alarm clock reads 8:20 P.M. I've been out for nine hours. The first decent sleep I've had in days. </p><p> "He hit another one." </p><p> Something sparks in my drowsy brain. "What?" </p><p> "This is the fourth time I've called in the past half hour, Cat." </p><p> The voice brings up a well of anger, longing, and guilt. It belongs to the detective I've been sleeping with for the past eighteen months. Sean Regan. An insightful, fascinating man with a wife and three kids. </p><p> "What did you say before?" I ask, ready to bite off Sean's head if he asks me to meet him somewhere. </p><p> "I said, he hit another one." </p><p> I blink and try to orient myself in the darkness. It's early August, and the purple glow of dusk filters through my curtains. God, my mouth is dry. "Where?" </p><p> "The Garden District. Owner of a printing company. Male Caucasian." </p><p> "Bite marks?" </p><p> "Worse than the others." </p><p> "How old was he?" </p><p> "Sixty-nine." </p><p> "Jesus. It is him." I'm already getting out of bed. "This makes no sense at all." </p><p> "Nope." </p><p> "Sexual predators kill women, Sean. Or children. Not old men." </p><p> "We've had this conversation. How fast can you get here? Piazza's hovering over me, and the chief himself may be coming down for a look." </p><p> I lift yesterday's jeans off the chair and slip them over my panties. Victoria's Secret, Sean's favorite pair, but he won't be seeing them tonight. Maybe not for a long time. Maybe never again. "Any gay angle on this victim? Did he use male prostitutes, anything like that?" </p><p> "Not even a tickle," Sean replies. "Looks as clean as the others." </p><p> "If he's got a home computer, confiscate it. He might -- " </p><p> "I know my job, Cat." </p><p> "I know, but -- " </p><p> "Cat." The single syllable is a probing finger. "Are you sober?" </p><p> A column of heat rises up my spine. I haven't had a sip of vodka for nearly forty-eight hours, but I'm not going to give Sean the satisfaction of answering his interrogation. "What's the victim's name?" </p><p> "Arthur LeGendre." His voice drops. "Are you sober, darlin'?" </p><p> The craving is already awake in my blood, like little teeth gnawing at the walls of my veins. I need the anesthetic burn of a shot of Grey Goose. Only I can't have that anymore. I've been using Valium to fight the physical withdrawal symptoms, but nothing can truly replace the alcohol that has kept me together for so long. </p><p> I shift the phone from shoulder to shoulder and pull a silk blouse from my closet. "Where are the bite marks?" </p><p> "Torso, nipples, face, penis." </p><p> I freeze. <i>"Face?</i> Are they deep?" </p><p> "Deep enough for you to take impressions, I think." </p><p> Excitement blunts the edge of my craving. "I'm on my way." </p><p> "Have you taken your meds?" </p><p> Sean knows me too well. No one else in New Orleans is even aware that I take anything. Lexapro for depression, Depakote for impulse control. I stopped taking both drugs three days ago, but I don't want to get into that with Sean. </p><p> "Stop worrying about me. Is the FBI there?" </p><p> "Half the task force is here, and they want to know what you think about these bite marks. The Bureau guy is photographing them, but you have that ultraviolet rig...and when it comes to teeth, you're the man." </p><p> Sean's admiring misstatement of my gender is typical cop talk, and it tells me he's speaking for the benefit of others. "What's the address?" </p><p> "Twenty-seven twenty-seven Prytania." </p><p> "Sounds like an address with a security system." </p><p> "Switched off." </p><p> "Just like the first one. Moreland." Our first victim -- one month ago -- was a retired army colonel, highly decorated in Vietnam. </p><p> "Just like that." Sean's voice drops to a whisper. "Get your lovely ass down here, okay?" </p><p> Today his Irish intimacy makes me want to jab him. "No 'I love you'?" I ask with feigned sweetness. </p><p> His reply is barely audible. "You know I'm surrounded." </p><p> <i>As usual.</i> "Yeah. I'll see you in fifteen minutes." </p><p> Night falls fast as I drive my Audi from my house on Lake Pontchartrain to the Garden District, the fragrant heart of New Orleans. I spent two minutes in the bathroom trying to make myself presentable, but my face is still swollen from sleep. I need caffeine. In five minutes I'll be surrounded by cops, FBI agents, forensic techs, the chief of robbery homicide, and possibly the chief of the NOPD. I'm accustomed to that kind of attention, but seven days ago -- the last time this predator hit -- I had a problem at the crime scene. Nothing too bad. A garden-variety panic attack, according to the EMT who checked me out. But panic attacks don't exactly inspire confidence in the hard men and women who work serial murder cases. The last thing they want is a consulting expert who can't hold her mud. </p><p> The word got around about my little episode, too. Sean told me that. Nobody could really believe it. Why did the woman that some homicide detectives call "the ice queen" suddenly lose her composure at the scene of a not-very-grisly murder? I'd like to know that myself. I have a theory, but analyzing one's own mental condition is a notoriously unreliable business. As for the sobriquet, I'm no ice queen, but in the macho world of law enforcement, playing that role is the only thing that keeps me safe -- from men and from my own rogue impulses. Of course, Sean gives the lie to that little strategy. </p><p> Four victims now, I remind myself, focusing on the case. Four men between the ages of forty-two and sixty-nine, all murdered within weeks of each other. In a single thirty-day period, to be exact. The pace of the killings is virtually unprecedented, and if the victims were women, the city would be gripped by terror. But because the victims are middle-aged or older men, a sort of fascinated curiosity has taken hold of New Orleans. Each victim has been shot in or near the spine, mutilated with human bites, then finished off with a coup de gr�ce shot to the head. The bites have increased in savagery from victim to victim, and they've also provided the strongest evidence against any future suspect -- mitochondrial DNA from the killer's saliva. </p><p> The bite marks are the reason for my involvement with the case. I'm a forensic odontologist, an expert on human teeth and the damage they can do. I acquired this knowledge in four boring years of dental school and five fascinating years of fieldwork. If people ask me what I do for a living, I tell them I'm a dentist, which is true enough and all they need to know. <i>Odontologist</i> doesn't mean anything to anybody, but in post-<i>CSI</i> America, <i>forensic</i> prompts questions I'd just as soon not answer in a grocery store. So, while most acquaintances know me as a dentist who's too busy to accept new patients, an assortment of government agencies -- including the FBI and the United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes -- knows me as one of the leading forensic odontologists in the world. Which is nice. I take my identity where I can find it. </p><p> The task force wants my expertise on bite marks tonight, but Sean Regan wants more. When he sought my help on a murder case two years ago, he soon learned that I knew about a lot more than teeth. I completed two years of medical school before I withdrew, and that gave me a strong foundation for self-education in forensics. Anatomy, hematology, histology, biochemistry, whatever a case requires. I can glean twice as much information from an autopsy report as any detective, and twice as fast. After Sean and I became closer than the rules allowed, he began using me unofficially to help with difficult cases. And used is the proper word; Sean Regan lives to catch killers, and he'll exploit anything and anyone to help him do it. </p><p> But Sean isn't simply a user. He's my comrade-in-arms, my rabbi, and my enabler. He doesn't judge me. He knows me for what I am, and he gives me what I need. Like Sean, I'm a born hunter. Not of animals. I've hunted animals, and I hate it. Animals are innocent; men are not. I am a hunter of men. But unlike Sean, I have no license to do this. Not really. Forensic odontology brings only tangential involvement with murder cases; it's my involvement with Sean that puts me into the bloody thick of things. By allowing me access -- unethical and probably illegal access -- to crime scenes, witnesses, and evidence, he has put me in a position to solve four major murder cases, one of them a serial. Sean took the credit every time, of course -- plus the attendant promotions -- and I let him do it. Why? Maybe because telling the truth would have exposed our love affair, gotten Sean fired, and freed the killers. But the truth is simpler than that. The truth is that I didn't care about the credit. I'd tasted the pulse-pounding rush of hunting predators, and I was addicted to it as surely as I am to the vodka I need so terribly at t...</p></p><h2>Dimensions Math Textbook 6A</h2><p>Dimensions Math is a series of textbooks designed for middle school students.

They all knew that old Cousin Joseph Calver had left his fortune to Waldo; and when Lady Lindeth had summoned him to account for himself she had acted on the impulse of the moment, and with no expectation of hearing the news denied. Nor had she had any very real expectation of Waldo's renouncing the bequest in favour of her only child. She naturally felt that no worthier heir to eccentric Cousin Joseph's estate existed than Julian; and she had done her best to introduce the noble orphan to him, even enduring the rigours of a week spent at Harrogate, when Julian had been an engaging child in nankeens and a frilled shirt, and she had tried (quite unavailingly) to gain entrance to Broom Hall. Three times had she driven out from Harrogate, the bored but docile little boy beside her, only to be told, twice, by Cousin Joseph's butler, that the Master was not feeling clever enough to receive visitors; and, once, that the Master would thank her not to come pestering him, because he didn't want to see her, nor her son, nor anyone else. Enquiry had elicited the information that the only visitor ever admitted into the house was the doctor. Local opinion was divided, charitable persons maintaining that a disappointment suffered in his youth was responsible for this churlishness; others asserting that he was a muckworm who grudged every groat he was obliged to spend. Having had the opportunity to perceive the neglected condition of the grounds of Broom Hall, Lady Lindeth had ranged herself with the majority. A suspicion that Cousin Joseph might not be as plump in the pocket as was supposed had occurred only to be dismissed: Broom Hall, though greatly inferior in style and size to young Lord Lindeth's seat in the Midlands, was a very respectable house, with probably as many as thirty bedrooms. It did not stand in a park, but its gardens appeared to be extensive; and she was credibly informed that most of the surrounding land belonged to the estate. She had left Harrogate much inclined to think that Cousin Joseph's fortune was considerably larger than had previously been supposed. She did not grudge it to him, but she would have thought herself a very unnatural parent had she not made a push to secure it for her son. So she had swallowed her resentment at the treatment she had received, and had continued, throughout the succeeding years, to send Joseph small Christmas gifts, and periodical letters, affectionately enquiring after the state of his health, and regaling him with accounts of Julian's virtues, beauty, and scholastic progress. And after all her pains he had left his entire estate to Waldo, who was neither the most senior of his relations nor the one who bore his name!</p> <p>The most senior of the three cousins gathered together in Lady Lindeth's drawing-room was George Wingham, the son of her ladyship's eldest sister. He was a very worthy man, however prosy; she was not particularly fond of him, but she thought she could have borne it better had Cousin Joseph made him his heir, for she was obliged to acknowledge that his seniority gave him a certain amount of right to the bequest. Not, of course, so good a right as Laurence Calver. Lady Lindeth held Laurence, the youngest of her nephews, in contempt and dislike, but she hoped she was a just woman, and she felt she could have supported with equanimity his succession to a fortune which he would have lost no time in dissipating.</p> <p>But that Cousin Joseph, ignoring the claims of George, and Laurence, and her beloved Julian, should have named Waldo Hawkridge as his heir was so intolerable that had she been of a nervous disposition she thought she must have succumbed to Spasms when she had first heard the incredible news. As it was, she had been unable to speak for a full minute; and when she did she had merely uttered Waldo's name, in a voice so vibrant with loathing that Julian, the bearer of the tidings, had been startled. &#x2018;But, Mama-!' he had expostulated. &#x2018;You like Waldo!'</p> <p>That was perfectly true, but quite beside the point, as she crossly told her son. She was, in fact, much attached to Waldo, but neither her fondness for him nor her gratitude for his unfailing kindness to Julian prevented her from feeling positively unwell whenever she thought of his enormous wealth. To learn that Cousin Joseph's estate was to be added to an already indecently large fortune did make her feel for a few minutes that so far from liking him she detested him.</p> <p>She said now, in a peevish tone: &#x2018;I can't conceive what should have induced that disagreeable old man to choose you for his heir!'</p> <p>&#x2018;There is no understanding it at all,' Sir Waldo replied sympathetically.</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't believe you ever so much as saw him, either!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, I never did.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I must own,' said George, &#x2018;that it was an odd sort of a thing to do. One would have thought However, none of us had the least claim on the old fellow, and I'm sure he had a perfect right to leave his money where he chose!'</p> <p>At this, Laurence Calver, who had been lounging on the sofa, and moodily playing with an ornate quizzing-glass, let the glass fall on the end of its ribbon, and jerked himself up, saying angrily: &#x2018;You had no claim to it or Waldo or Lindeth! But I'm a Calver! I I think it damnable!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Very possibly!' snapped his aunt. &#x2018;But you will be good enough not to use such language in my presence, if you please!'</p> <p>He coloured, and mumbled an apology, but the reproof did nothing to improve his temper, and he embarked on a long and incoherent diatribe, which ranged stammeringly over a wide ground, embracing all the real and fancied causes of his sense of ill-usage, the malevolence of Joseph Calver, and the suspected duplicity of Waldo Hawkridge.</p> <p>Until George Wingham intervened, he was heard in unresponsive silence. His oblique animadversions on Sir Waldo's character did indeed bring a flash into Lord Lindeth's eyes, but he folded his lips tightly on a retort. Laurence had always been jealous of Waldo: everyone knew that; and very ludicrous it was to watch his attempts to outshine his cousin. He was several years younger than Waldo, and he possessed none of the attributes which Nature had so generously bestowed on the Nonesuch. Failing to excel in any of the sports which had won for Waldo his title, he had lately turned towards the dandy-set, abandoning the sporting attire of the Corinthian for all the extravagances of fashion popular amongst the young dandies. Julian, three years his junior, thought that he looked ridiculous in any guise; and instinctively turned his eyes towards Waldo. They warmed as they looked, for to Julian Sir Waldo was at once a magnificent personage in whose company it was an honour to be seen, the big cousin who had taught him to ride, drive, shoot, fish, and box; a fount of wisdom; and the surest refuge in times of stress. He had even taught him something of his own way with the starched folds of a neckcloth: not the intricacies of the Mathematical or the Oriental Tie, but an elegant fashion of his own, as unobtrusive as it was exquisite. Laurence would do well to imitate the quiet neatness of Waldo's dress, Julian thought, not realizing that the plain, close-fitting coats which so admirably became Waldo could only be worn to advantage by men of splendid physique. Less fortunate aspirants to high fashion were obliged to adopt a more florid style, with padding to disguise sloping shoulders, and huge, laid-back lapels to widen a narrow chest.</p> <p>He glanced again at Laurence, not so much folding his lips as gripping them tightly together, to keep back the retort he knew Waldo didn't wish him to utter. From vapourings about the injustice of fate, Laurence, working himself into a passion, was becoming more particular in his complaints. Any stranger listening to him would have supposed that Waldo was wealthy at his expense, Julian thought indignantly: certainly that Waldo had always treated him shabbily. Well, whether Waldo liked it or not, he was not going to sit meekly silent any longer!</p> <p>But before he could speak George had intervened, saying in a voice of grim warning: &#x2018;Take care! If anyone has cause to be grateful to Waldo, you have, you distempered young Jack-at-warts!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, George, don't be a fool!' begged Sir Waldo.</p> <p>His stolid senior paid no heed to this, but kept his stern gaze on Laurence. &#x2018;Who paid your Oxford debts?' he demanded. &#x2018;Who gets you out of sponging-houses? Who saved you from the devil's own mess, not a month ago? I know to what tune you were bit at that hell in Pall Mall! no, it wasn't Waldo who told me, so you needn't cast any of your black looks at him! The Sharps tried on the grand mace with you, didn't they? Lord, it was all hollow for them! You were born a bleater!'</p> <p>&#x2018;That's enough!' Waldo interrupted.</p> <p>&#x2018;It is! More than enough!' said George rebelliously.</p> <p>&#x2018;Tell me, Laurie,' said Waldo, ignoring this interpolation, &#x2018;do you want a house in Yorkshire?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, but what do you want with it? Why should you have it? You've got Manifold you've got a town house you've got that place in Leicestershire and you ain't even a Calver!'</p> <p>&#x2018;And what the devil has that to say to anything?' struck in George. &#x2018;What have the Calvers to do with Manifold, pray? Or with the house in Charles Street? Or with '</p> <p>&#x2018;George, if you don't hold your tongue we shall be at outs, you and I!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, very well!' growled George. &#x2018;But when that ramshackle court-card starts talking as though he thought he ought to own Manifold, which has been in your family since the lord knows when !'</p> <p>&#x2018;He doesn't think anything of the sort. He thinks merely that he ought to own Broom Hall. But what would you do with it if you did own it, Laurie? I haven't seen it, but I collect it's a small estate, subsisting on the rents of various farms and holdings. Have you a fancy for setting up as an agriculturist?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, I have not!' replied Laurence angrily. &#x2018;If that sneaking screw had left it to me, I'd have sold it which I don't doubt you'll do as though you weren't swimming in riches already!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, you would have sold it, and wasted its price within six months. Well, I can put it to better use than that.' The smile crept back into his eyes; he said consolingly: &#x2018;Does it comfort you to know that it won't add to my riches? It won't: quite the reverse, I daresay!'</p> <p>Mr Wingham directed a sharply suspicious look at him, but it was Lady Lindeth who spoke, exclaiming incredulously: &#x2018;What? Do you mean to tell me that that detestable old man wasn't possessed of a handsome fortune after all?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Doing it rather too brown!' said Laurence, his not uncomely features marred by a sneer.</p> <p>&#x2018;I can't tell you yet what he was possessed of, ma'am, but I've been given no reason to suppose that he's made me heir to more than a competence deriving, I collect, from the estate. And as you and George have both frequently described to me the deplorable state of decay into which the place has fallen I should imagine that the task of bringing it into order is likely to swallow the revenue, and a good deal more besides.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Is that what you mean to do?' asked Julian curiously. &#x2018;Bring it into order?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Possibly: I can't tell, until I've seen it.'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, of course Waldo, you know I don't want it, but what the dooce do you Oh!' He broke off, laughing, and said mischievously: &#x2018;I'll swear I know, but I won't tell George word of a Lindeth!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Tell me?' said George, with a scornful snort. &#x2018;Do you take me for a flat, young sauce-box? He wants it for another Orphan Asylum, of course!'</p> <p>&#x2018;An Orphan Asylum!' Laurence jerked himself to his feet, staring at Sir Waldo with narrowed, glittering eyes. &#x2018;So that's it, is it? What ought to be mine is to be squandered on the staff and raff of the back-slums! You don't want it yourself, but you'd rather by far benefit a set of dirty, worthless brats than your own kith and kin!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't think you are concerned with any of my kith and kin other than yourself, Laurie,' replied Sir Waldo. &#x2018;That being so yes, I would.'</p> <p>&#x2018;You you By God, you make me sick!' Laurence said, trembling with fury.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, take yourself off!' recommended Julian, as flushed as Laurence was pale. &#x2018;You only came here to nose out what you might, and you've done that! And if you think you're at liberty to insult Waldo under any roof of mine I'll have you know you're much mistaken!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Make yourself easy: I'm going, toad-eater!' Laurence flung at him. &#x2018;And you need not put yourself to the trouble of escorting me downstairs! Ma'am, your very obedient servant!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Tragedy Jack!' remarked George, as the door slammed behind the outraged dandy. &#x2018;Well-done, young 'un!' He added, with a grin that suddenly lightened his rather heavy countenance: &#x2018;You and your roofs! Try telling me I came to nose out what I might and see what I'll do to you!'</p> <p>Julian laughed, relaxing. &#x2018;Well, you did, but that's different! You don't grudge Cousin Joseph's property to Waldo any more than I do!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, but that ain't to say I don't grudge it to those curst brats of his!' said George frankly. He was himself a man of substance, but he was also the father of a large and hopeful family, and although he would have repudiated with indignation any suggestion that he was not very well able to provide for his children, he had for years been unable to consider his unknown and remote cousin's problematical fortune without thinking that it would furnish him with a useful addition to his own estate. He was neither an unkindly nor an ungenerous man; he subscribed what was proper to Charity; but he did feel that Waldo carried the thing to excess. That, of course, was largely the fault of his upbringing: his father, the late Sir Thurstan Hawkridge, had been a considerable philanthropist; but George could not remember that he had ever gone to such absurd lengths as to succour and educate the lord only knew how many of the nameless and gallows-born waifs with which every city was ridden.</p> <p>He looked up, to find that Waldo was watching him, the faintest hint of a question in his eyes. He reddened, saying roughly: &#x2018;No, I don't want Broom Hall, and I hope I know better than to waste my time recommending you not to drop your blunt providing for a parcel of paupers who won't thank you for it, and, you may depend upon it, won't grow up to be the respectable citizens you think they will, either! But I must say I do wonder what made that old miser leave his money to you!'</p> <p>Sir Waldo could have enlightened him, but thought it more tactful to refrain from divulging that he figured in his eccentric relative's Will as &#x2018;the only member of my family who has paid no more heed to me than I have to him.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, for my part I think it very unsatisfactory,' said Lady Lindeth. &#x2018;And not at all what poor Cousin Joseph would have wished!'</p> <p>&#x2018;You do mean to do that, Waldo?' Julian asked.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, I think so, if I find the place at all suitable. It may not be and in any event I don't want it prattled about, so just you keep your tongue, young man!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, of all the abominable injustices ! I didn't prattle about your horrid brats: it was George! Waldo, if you mean to go north, may I go with you?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Why, yes, if you wish, but you'll find it a dead bore, you know.

He showed them how to plant corn, beans, and squash, and how to hunt and fish. And when a good harvest was gathered in the fall, the two peoples feasted together in the spirit of peace and brotherhood.<br> Almost four hundred years later, the tradition continues. . . .<br></p><p>Most American children know the story of the Pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving, but the Native American side of the tale is far less familiar. Joseph Bruchac, a prolific and award-winning author of Native American descent (<i>The First Strawberries</i>, <i>A Boy Called Slow</i>) describes life in 1620 for a man who was destined to save the Pilgrims even as he was losing his family and tribe. Told from Squanto's point of view, this historically accurate and detailed story brings to life one of the most important moments in America's past. Demonstrating how much his people (the Patuxet, the People of the Falls) value honor, Squanto befriends English traders, even after being kidnapped and taken to Spain. After much hard work, Squanto manages to sail back to his homeland, where, in spite of his discovery that many of his people have died from disease brought by white people, he acts as envoy between the English and his own people, and helps the pilgrims survive in their new world.<p> Throughout this moving tale, Squanto's belief that "these men can share our land as friends" poignantly shines through. Greg Shed's gouache illustrations capture the warmth and dignity of Squanto and his friends. Young readers will be fascinated by this lesser-known perspective on the Thanksgiving tradition that remains strong today.

Roland Roycraft takes you step by step through his unusual watercolor painting technique of pouring paint. You&#39;ll see first-hand how to use his special masking and pouring techniques to give a glowing quality to your work. You&#39;ll learn how to capture the sparkle of light on snow . . . the gentle glow of the sky dawn and sunset . . . and the way light shines on and through water. This pouring technique is a new way to use glazing to capture dozens of subtle color variations across an area -- the gradations of blue in water, and the various blues and grays found in the sky. Because pouring causes the color to tint rather than cover the paper, your colors remain brilliant even after as many as ten to fifteen layers have been poured. You&#39;ll learn how to use masking to allow you more freedom in applying colors. Masking also allows you to work from dark to light -- the reverse of the usual procedure. Whether you&#39;re a beginning artist or an experienced painter who wants to explore new techniques, this book will give you inspiration and insight into the art of watercolor.</p><p>Roland Roycraft spent 35 years as a commercial artist and art director with work appearing in national publications such as Saturday Evening Post, Life and Look.

There I live as an old gumshoe or jelly bean should, with my middle-aged maid, Maria, and a stray dog rescued from the garbage. Out at sea, the porpoises that never sleep. La Mision had been Larry&#x2019;s exile for decades. He built a Spanish-style villa perched on the rocks within sight of the old La Fonda Hotel and Bar, where, it is rumored by the staff, the margarita was invented during Rita Hayworth&#x2019;s many fiestas at that same establishment. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if it isn&#x2019;t true. But I too had known La Fonda, La Mision&#x2019;s only hotel, for years. I used to drive down here in the &#x2019;50s, when it was still beautiful, before the world was turned into a silo of unsatisfactory teenage fantasies and a garbage dumpster of schemes. Before the SunCor corporation littered the coast with golf resorts and there was any such thing as spring break in Rosarito Beach. Back then I&#x2019;d go there to lie on a bed in a dark room and dry out. By the &#x2019;70s, I was still drying out and no longer noticed whole decades passing in the night.</p><p>The cliffs of teddy bear cholla remain. The lonely hot roads in the interior and the little churches with their tin-painted retablos of car accidents and death by cancer. The Pacific with lines of kelp, chilling waves rolling in to a beach between rock headlands shrouded with mist and spray. This is what all of California once looked like. Close your eyes and wonder. I often do. How easy it was to destroy, easier than destroying a cherry cake with a plastic fork. All for a bit of tin.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s a good place for an old man. A sanctuary of clean wind and two hundred days of sun. On weekends I played the casinos in Ensenada. There was a bar there called Porfirio&#x2019;s, I think, which had a machine on the counter called El Electrucador. It was a kind of Van de Graaff generator with two finger pads. You put your fingers on the pads and the barman, with some noise and fuss, gave you a stiff shock. If you could withstand it, you got a free shot of mescal. I didn&#x2019;t need to get it free, but I got it free all the same. I figured the shocks were doing my intestines and hair roots some good. People said I looked much younger when I came back from my weekends. They said I looked &#x201c;returned from the dead.&#x201d; At my age, I&#x2019;ll take any compliment.</p><p>We, the old guard, go to the terrace of La Fonda at night to eat its roast suckling pig and often stay there all day playing cards among ourselves under the palapas and running up our tabs. Alive is a relative word.</p><p>They play Los Tres Ases and Los Panchos tracks on the sound system, and there are some of us who can dream backward to the splendid years. There is still an occasional glimpse of the old times here, and maybe it&#x2019;s the last glimpse we&#x2019;ll ever enjoy. Has there ever in history been a time when four decades could turn everything upside down in such a conclusive way? I can remember the summer of 1950 in this very same place. Men in flannel suits and the women dressed like movie stars to go to the supermarket in the daytime. Thirty-eight years on--not a great amount of time when you think about it--the gentle sound of swing has given way to Guns N&#x2019; Roses. Back then, the old Mexico was still there, hanging on to life with style. Pedro Infante was on the screens and Maria F�lix was in the air. They were destroyed to make way for Madonna.</p><p>Then one day, after a low near-decade of sloth and decay and Ronald Reagan, two men from the Pacific Mutual insurance company walked into the terrace bar of La Fonda Hotel. They were dressed like undertakers and had sauntered down from the main road above the hotel, finding me seated alone with my pitcher of sangria and my silver-tipped cane as if they had known I would be there unaccompanied within sight of my home on the Baja cliffs. They knew which house it was, too, because their eyes rose to take it in, and they smiled with the small contempt of company men.</p><p>They&#x2019;d heard I was retired, but a man they trusted in La Jolla had said I was the best that money couldn&#x2019;t buy. That was, of course, the best joke of the afternoon. They offered to buy me an early dinner and bared the teeth of friendly hyenas who have done their killing for the day. The older one held out a card that gave his name, Michael D. Kalb, and the other simply told me his: O&#x2019;Kane. Kalb had at least twenty years over his colleague, but both of them were lean enough to carry the undertaker look. When I had put down the habanero and they had settled down into their chairs, the older one spoke with a voice that made me think of a father telling a bedtime tale to a child with attention-deficit problems. He glanced with distaste at the Baja beach and his eyes were dead. Boys sat there under palapas, selling cattle skulls and lumps of floating kelp hacked out of the waves, yet it was clear that Kalb didn&#x2019;t know their world, or mine, and that he had probably never ventured so far south before. Was he surprised that the sun still shone so gently?</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Marlowe. Sandy and I weren&#x2019;t sure we&#x2019;d be able to find you down here. You bought that house on the cliff?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s called Danish Mansion. A lifetime of beating people up went into buying it.&#x201d;</p><p>They laughed, but there was surprisingly little sound.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get some margaritas,&#x201d; Kalb went on loudly. &#x201c;I like the frosted glasses with the salt around the rim.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They were invented at this hotel,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Rita Hayworth used to come here. Margarita Hayworth.&#x201d;</p><p>I wondered who had recommended me. Years had gone by since I was last on a case, beating sidewalks in proper leather shoes, yet many of my former employers were probably still alive. Deirdre Gowan in Del Mar, ancient but able to remember my services; the Garland family whose daughter had gone missing in &#x2019;79, and whose happiness I had restored. They were not yet ghosts.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an easy job,&#x201d; the younger one said. &#x201c;Did you ever meet an American called Donald Zinn down here in La Mision? They say he used to come to Mexico a lot.&#x201d;</p><p>I said I&#x2019;d never heard of him.</p><p>&#x201c;Surprising. But anyway, he was a developer with a lot of debt who died in a swimming accident in a place called Caleta de Campos in Michoac�n last month. He had a policy with us and we have to pay the widow. The paperwork all checks out fine on the Mexican side.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Except,&#x201d; said Kalb, &#x201c;that it&#x2019;s not entirely fine with us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In what way?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Zinn had a policy with us for a number of years, and he had included his wife of about seven years. So there&#x2019;s nothing suspicious about recent events relative to the policy. But we understand he had been going to Caleta de Campos for a number of years and that he was not prone to doing risky or adventurous things that might endanger his health.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Drugs, maybe,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Kane said.</p><p>&#x201c;What I&#x2019;m trying to say is that there was no reason to increase his premiums or regard his policy as risky. Quite the opposite. Despite being profligate with his money, he was not considered a risk by our department. But with a death in Mexico, we never know what the circumstances really are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Suppose,&#x201d; the other chimed in, &#x201c;he had committed suicide or even died in the course of committing a crime. Our liabilities wouldn&#x2019;t be entirely the same. The picture would change.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you see, Mr. Marlowe? It&#x2019;s remarkably easy to bribe people down there here to alter facts on a death certificate. It happens all the time. Caleta is a small village on the coast, fairly remote. It&#x2019;s at least seventeen hundred miles south of the border. The embassy in Mexico City receives the report from the local police, the local coroner, and so on, and they rubber-stamp it before forwarding it to us. Most of these claims are not questioned. The insurance companies just pay out and they leave it at that. And yet we know fraud is going on. Well, maybe not fraud in this case. Maybe an embellishment of the truth to make Mr. Zinn look less responsible for his own demise than he might have been. What, for example, if he had been high on drugs at the time he was trying to swim across the bay at Caleta de Campos? I think that would change things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have to pay out less?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Possibly. There&#x2019;s also the question of the cremation. He was cremated locally in Mexico, and very quickly. It&#x2019;s unusual to say the least. We&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that it might be worthwhile for us to take a second look at the file. We thought you might like to go down there and check it out for us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, he hung around in a number of places. As well as Caleta de Campos, he liked to big-game fish in Mazatlan. Perhaps we could get a better idea of what was going on the days leading up to his death.&#x201d;</p><p>They had with them an envelope, which was now laid upon the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s some information on him. The widow is named Dolores Araya and she&#x2019;s still running the resort they built together near El Centro, out in the desert on the American side. You could go up and have a chat with her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t accepted yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have a point there! Shall we have another round of margaritas?&#x201d; Kalb said, slapping his hand on the counter. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying it&#x2019;ll influence you. You&#x2019;ll only do it if you want to do it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m thinking about.&#x201d;</p><p>The drinks arrived. I hadn&#x2019;t worked in ten years and I had retired too late as it was. In those final days, I felt I had run out of courage rather than energy. Seventy-two isn&#x2019;t a bad age, but sixty-two is too old to be working. You are just impersonating the man you used to be. Retirement had seemed like the best way not to die, but the adrenaline had gone the day I threw in the towel and it never returned. You have your books and your movies, your daydreams and your moments in the sun, but none of those can save you any more than irony can.</p><p>I looked out now at the beach and felt as bored as I had the night before. The same old conversations of expats who were declining night by night on the terrace. The same gossip about neighbors and real estate deals and aging adultery and petty crime down the coast in Ensenada. The same overheightened indignations about things that didn&#x2019;t really matter. I realized then that I had never anticipated getting old or not being needed. I was suddenly flattered by the presence of these two men in slim black suits with their salty lips, even when Sandy said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best man for the job. We need someone inconspicuous.&#x201d;</p><p>Someone far and away over the hill, in other words.</p><p>His colleague assured me that it was nothing strenuous or physically risky. It would not be like the old days. I was too far gone to be a hero, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have to be one.</p><p>&#x201c;We know you speak fluent Spanish, and that&#x2019;s the essential thing. You&#x2019;d just be collecting some information for us. Would you like a couple of days to think about it?&#x201d;</p><p>Kalb handed me his card and I was tempted to refuse it just to see the look in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;I always decide on the spot, you know. It&#x2019;s a bad habit, but it&#x2019;s a habit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So?&#x201d;</p><p>I knocked back the second margarita and rolled a coin in my head. It came out heads, and I always go with heads.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I could give it a try.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Excellent,&#x201d; Kalb said, and there was a subtle relief in his tone. &#x201c;I can set up a contract with my office tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>And he rattled off terms.</p><p>&#x201c;You can make that three hundred a day expenses,&#x201d; I interrupted him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d want to go to San Diego and see where and how Donald Zinn had spent his time, and then go to the resort and see Dolores Araya. Seeing the wife is always the fun part.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Then we have an agreement?&#x201d;</p><p>We shook hands then, and the two relaxed and pushed forward the envelope that lay before us. Inside were a sheaf of photographs of both Zinn and his wife, and the places they liked to frequent in happier days, including the Marius restaurant at the Meridien Hotel in San Diego. It was a portrait of a marriage on two hundred thousand a year and a marina house on Coronado Cays. They had been told that the wife no longer went to the house but they had the keys, which I could pick up from their office when I was in town. How they had obtained them, they didn&#x2019;t say.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that legal, to go inside their house?&#x201d; I said, now that I was on their little team.</p><p>&#x201c;Old Donald had a mountain of debt, so the bank took the house and pretty much everything else. We came to an understanding with them. But no, it&#x2019;s not legal. So if you want to look at the house, you&#x2019;ll do it discreetly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So he was bankrupt?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dry as a salted fish. We can&#x2019;t understand how he came to have so much money in the first place. Perhaps he never did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The con men with great hair are the best,&#x201d; I said, looking at the photographs.</p><p>He was good looking in his way, with hair that age had not thinned or otherwise fallen into disgrace. The eyes were full of torment, the eternal fear of being exposed and hunted. A San Diego pill, not quite in the first rank but blessed by the creator with a Roman nose. The clothes he wore were fine, with the heft of heavy cotton--I understood the attraction. Fragments of equally fine cars appeared in some shots.</p><p>&#x201c;I get the picture,&#x201d; I said, putting the sheaf down. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead but he&#x2019;s still living. If he&#x2019;s dead, maybe I should go meet his ghost. It&#x2019;ll be extra if I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Kalb said with his glacial grin.</p></p><h2>Of Whom the World Was Not Worthy</h2><p>"We must believe with all our hearts and souls that He is with us. He is a God of love!" So shouted Jakob, the evangelist, as the German tanks roared across Yugoslavian soil, and machine guns, motorcycles and Messerschmitts screamed in the hills.<p></p><p>Out of the sky came the Stukas. They nosed over, dropped their bombs and veered off into the cold blue. The wagon in front of them was hit. The donkey was dead, and the driver lay mutilated in the brush at the side of the road.</p><p>"This is war," said the gray-clad officer. "The only place you will be safe is in the grave."</p><p>Weak and divided, the Yugoslavians fought back. Their ill-equipped guerrillas chewed on the German army like vermin on the flanks of a stallion. They cut phone lines, laid mines, dynamited bridges and blew up armored cars. Their stubborn war cry was, "Better grave than slave!" But, for every German they killed a hundred Yugoslavs were shot in retaliation.</p><p>In the midst of this living hell, Jakob, Jozeca and other believers clung to God and prayed for both friend and foe. The enemies of their beloved homeland could burn their cities and towns, but they could not destroy their souls or quench their indomitable spirits.</p><p>Marie Chapian went to Yugoslavia and interviewed peasants, gypsies, factory workers, doctors, laborers, and officials of the Communist party.

The girls set out across upstate New York in a trailer to track him down . . . and stumble onto another mystery along the way!</p><p>JULIE CAMPBELL, in the 1940s, was running her own literary agency when Western Publishing put out a call for talented authors to write mystery series for kids. Julie proposed the Trixie Belden series and wrote the first six titles herself. She also started the Ginnie Gordon series and wrote several Cherry Ames books. Julie Campbell died in 1999.Sure enough, it was already sprinkling when the girls returned their horses to the riding academy, and they had to run all the way to the <i>Swan</i> to keep from getting soaked. The rain kept up a steady drumming on the roof of the trailer all day, and the girls were forced to play indoor games and read, but it was hard to control their impatience.<br>At last Trixie said restlessly, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand being cooped up here any longer. Let&#x2019;s dash over to the restaurant and play some Ping-Pong before dinner.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Miss Trask agreed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a nap, but wear your slickers and rubbers. If either of you should catch cold it would ruin the trip.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Honey assured her. &#x201c;And please don&#x2019;t let the dogs follow us. They&#x2019;ve already brought in so much mud Trixie and I&#x2019;ll have to spend most of the morning scrubbing the place.&#x201d;<br>They raced around the park in their oilskin capes and hoods and sloshed up the steps to the cafeteria veranda. Everybody in Autoville seemed to have gathered inside and out of the clubhouse, and people were waiting in line for the use of the Ping-Pong table.<br>&#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; Trixie complained. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to do here either. I wish we could fall asleep and not wake up until it&#x2019;s time to start looking for Jim tomorrow morning.&#x201d;<br>Honey was examining a magazine at the newsstand. &#x201c;This quiz test looks like fun,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s find out how smart we are.&#x201d; She bought two copies of the magazine and Trixie followed her to a quiet corner of the library. &#x201c;Ready, get set, go,&#x201d; Honey said. &#x201c;The one who gets through first and has the most right answers is the smartest.&#x201d;<br>Trixie scribbled a few answers in the blank spaces after the questions in the test, but in a short while her thoughts began to wander. &#x201c;I always get sleepy on rainy days,&#x201d; she yawned, bored. &#x201c;Wish I&#x2019;d stayed back at the <i>Swan</i> with Miss Trask and taken a nap.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sleepy too,&#x201d; Honey admitted. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s doze right here in these comfortable chairs. We can finish the quiz later.&#x201d;<br>It seemed to Trixie that she had hardly closed her eyes when she was awakened by the sound of whispering on the other side of the thin beaver-board wall that separated the library from one of the back rooms in the cafeteria.<br>&#x201c;&#x2013;abandoned barn,&#x201d; someone was saying, &#x201c;on that truck farm. Perfectly safe. Hasn&#x2019;t been used in years. Doubt if the farmer even remembers it&#x2019;s there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re taking an awful chance,&#x201d; came a whining whisper. &#x201c;We were better off where we were.&#x201d;<br>Trixie sat up. That voice, she felt sure, belonged to Jeff!<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be stupid,&#x201d; the other voice said hoarsely. &#x201c;Those kids rode into the clearing after we passed them on the highway. If they saw that net and guessed&#x2013;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Those dumb kids!&#x201d; Jeff snorted. &#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t suspect anything even if they did happen to notice the net. What do you think they are, state troopers?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking no chances,&#x201d; the other man insisted. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t look dumb to me and you could tell by the way they were riding along, watching the side of the road, they were looking for something.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, all right,&#x201d; Jeff gave in. &#x201c;But it beats me how you&#x2019;re going to get to that barn without being seen by the farmer who owns it. That van&#x2019;s not exactly small, in case you haven&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I keep telling you,&#x201d; the other man whispered impatiently. &#x201c;Through the back fields. There&#x2019;s an old road leading from the orchard to the barn.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And fine shape it&#x2019;ll be in after this rain,&#x201d; Jeff argued. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re sure to get stuck in the mud tonight; but have it your own way. I&#x2019;ll play along, but it sure gets my goat that a couple of clumsy girls can make us change our plans.&#x201d;<br>The two men moved away from the wall, and in a few seconds Trixie saw the silhouette of a bushy-haired man move furtively past the library window. She hurried to the veranda, straining her eyes to get a better glimpse of him. He turned as though he might have heard her tiptoeing after him, and she crouched down hastily behind a bench. Peeking through the slats in the back of the bench, Trixie held her breath as the man took a few steps in her direction. Then, jamming a battered hat down over his thick, unruly hair, he wheeled and vaulted over the porch railing to disappear in the shadows of the bushes.</p><h2>The Story of the Constitution, 2nd Edition</h2><p>This course is for students, young and old alike, who wish to understand the Constitution.

Wherry Award and the Carlton R. Worth Award, for the contribution his numerous articles and books have made on the subject of plants.<br><br>"Threats to Wild Populations of Trilliums"<br><b><br>Picking Wild Trilliums.</b><br>It is popularly believed that picking a trillium even one time kills the plants. This is not true. Trilliums, like all green plants, obtain their food from the process of photosynthesis, the manufacture of carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water using the energy of sunlight. The organs of food-making are the green leaves, the light energy capturing and converting agent the green pigment chlorophyll. Naturally, anything which deprives the plant of its leaves injures it. Once picked, trilliums cannot produce another set of leaves until their cold dormancy requirement is satisfied, but trilliums have large, heavy rhizomes which store a considerable amount of food. If the plant picked is of reasonable health and size, it will appear the following season. If the rhizome is large and healthy enough, it may even bloom. There simply is no truth to the statement that picking a trillium once kills it. However, our experience from our many lecture appearances and what we have written in the past indicates that some zealots ignore the facts and go right on believing the "facts" they want to believe.<br><b><br>Grazing by Wild or Domestic Animals.</b><br> It is true that repeated picking of the same plant, season after season before it can manufacture enough food to maintain itself, will eventually kill it. A far greater threat to most wild <i>Trillium</i> populations than human picking is grazing by wild or domestic animals ... Repeated grazing, unlike the one-time picking of an individual plant, takes the same plants season after season, depleting their food reserves until they die. Maintaining wild deer herds at reasonable levels will save more trilliums than all the "education" not to pick. This is not to say that we advocate or approve of wanton picking, but there simply are not that many people out picking trilliums, and young children and the uninformed will pick a few no matter what people say.<br><b><br>Commercial Digging of Wild Trilliums.</b><br> Commercial collecting from wild trillium populations is not a good situation, as repeated collecting of a given area can deplete parental stocks or eliminate a rare species. Nursery propagation certainly is preferable and a better conservation practice. Some propagation techniques are available, but present methods are slow, tedious, and commercially unprofitable ... Some native plant dealers offer trillium rhizomes in quantity lots at wholesale and retail. Most do not state the origin of their plants; some call them "nursery stock." To our knowledge, no true commercial quantity "propagation" takes place at the present time. The reader must realize that the term "nursery stock" may be misleading. In some states or other legal districts, wild-collected material can be kept in beds or rows for a specified period of time and then be classed as nursery stock. If no laws covering the situation exist, dealers can call these plants what they may. Most trilliums offered today were collected in the wild. When taken legally from areas slated for development, we have no objection. In fact, we encourage legal rescue operations where the plants will otherwise be destroyed anyway. It is better that the gene pool be maintained in cultivation than totally destroyed. What we object to is illegal mass collecting from wild lands.<br><br> On the other hand, the amount of wild trillium material collected and sold or exported does not, so far as we can determine, approach the numbers given by zealous conservationists, conservation lobbyists, and those who seek to block export of all trilliums or to make a political issue of collecting them ... We do not condone mass commercial collecting from the wild. Threatened and endangered species of all wildlife should be protected by law, but we also believe there should be legal means by which properly qualified, trained botanists and horticulturists can bring into cultivation seed or selected, choice individuals of desired species, multiply them, and make them available to commercial sources so that anyone interested in these beautiful and worthy garden subjects can obtain them ... <br><b><br>Commercial Lumbering Techniques.</b><br> The type of commercial lumber harvesting utilized can have a big influence upon native wild plant populations ... A new and, to many biologists, disturbing lumbering practice has appeared and is widely utilized in the southern United States and now in northern large private lumber company lands. In this method, the area is clear-cut. All sizes of timber may be utilized: anything not of high quality is chipped for chipboard. No trees are left. Then, the land may be burned to kill brush and eventually sprayed with herbicide "to kill weed trees." Finally, special trees, often hybrids or exotic species, are planted for a future timber harvest. This cut, slash, burn, and herbicide practice takes an enormous toll upon some native plants, alters the paths of natural succession, and may exclude the return of some native plants. For the more delicate natives, lady's slippers and other wild orchids, as for trilliums, the full effect on their populations is unknown. Any practice that totally alters a habitat usually takes out all individuals of a species dependent upon it, both adults and seedlings. With today's technology, massive machinery, and aerial spraying of vast areas with powerful herbicides, we are concerned about the impact on trilliums and other native plant populations ... <br>"Legal Protection of North American Trilliums"<br>In spite of all the dire talk and a few problem situations, most American <i>Trillium</i> species seem to be holding their own at present. Within the sometimes limited distributional ranges, if one enters the proper habitat, the species will be present, usually frequent, and, in the case of <i> T. grandiflorum</i>, <i> T. erectum</i>, <i><br> T. sessile</i>, and <i> T. recurvatum</i>, and many others, locally abundant. Many species thrive not only in mature forest, but also in second-growth forest and brushland, and some can invade fallow fields. Except for the species identified under the U.S. Endangered or Threatened Species Act, just a few <i> Trillium</i><br> species of very limited natural distribution may, at present, be in trouble. Only in urban areas, developments, some commercial lumber tracts, and areas of excessive human or deer population do most trilliums truly suffer and their numbers decline. With continued human population growth and all its demands upon the land, we can expect that wildflower populations of all types will be increasingly stressed and damaged. We ought to set about now, before they become endangered, to protect our native plant treasures for the future.</p><h2>I Can&#39;t Make This Up: Life Lessons</h2><p><b>INSTANT #1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER</b><br> <br>Superstar comedian and Hollywood box office star Kevin Hart turns his immense talent to the written word by writing some words. Some of those words include: <i>the</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>above</i>, and even <i>even</i>. Put them together and you have the funniest, most heartfelt, and most inspirational memoir on survival, success, and the importance of believing in yourself since <i>Old Yeller</i>.<br><br>The question you&#x2019;re probably asking yourself right now is: What does Kevin Hart have that a book also has?<br> <br>According to the three people who have seen Kevin Hart and a book in the same room, the answer is clear:<br> <br>A book is compact. Kevin Hart is compact.<br> <br>A book has a spine that holds it together. Kevin Hart has a spine that holds him together.<br> <br>A book has a beginning. Kevin Hart&#x2019;s life uniquely qualifies him to write this book by also having a beginning.<br> <br>It begins in North Philadelphia. He was born an accident, unwanted by his parents. His father was a drug addict who was in and out of jail. His brother was a crack dealer and petty thief. And his mother was overwhelmingly strict, beating him with belts, frying pans, and his own toys.<br> <br>The odds, in short, were stacked against our young hero, just like the odds that are stacked against the release of a new book in this era of social media (where Hart has a following of over 100 million, by the way).<br> <br>But Kevin Hart, like Ernest Hemingway, JK Rowling, and Chocolate Droppa before him, was able to defy the odds and turn it around. In his literary debut, he takes the reader on a journey through what his life was, what it is today, and how he&#x2019;s overcome each challenge to become the man he is today.<br> <br>And that man happens to be the biggest comedian in the world, with tours that sell out football stadiums and films that have collectively grossed over $3.5 billion.<br> <br>He achieved this not just through hard work, determination, and talent: It was through his unique way of looking at the world. Because just like a book has chapters, Hart sees life as a collection of chapters that each person gets to write for himself or herself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not only do you get to choose how you interpret each chapter, but your interpretation writes the next chapter,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;So why not choose the interpretation that serves your life the best?&#x201d;</p><p>Kevin Hart is an award-winning actor and comedian. His films, including<i> Kevin Hart: What Now?</i>, <i>Central Intelligence, Think Like a Man</i>, <i>Get Hard, Ride Along</i>,<i> The Wedding Ringer, </i>and <i>The Secret Life of Pets </i>have earned over $3.5 billion at the box office. His stand-up comedy tours, including <i>Let Me Explain, Laugh at My Pain, </i>and <i>What Now?, </i>have sold out arenas and football stadiums, leading <i>Forbes</i> to name him the &#x201c;king of comedy.&#x201d; He is also the first comedian with a Nike sneaker line; a television producer, creating the BET show <i>Real Husbands of Hollywood</i> and the Laugh Out Loud Network; and CEO of Hartbeat Productions.

Typically, it&#x2019;s spoken while pulling your neck back, raising your eyebrows, and quickly scanning the room to make sure everything looks normal and you&#x2019;re not in some weird-ass dream.<br> <br>The dictionary definition of the word is: &#x201c;Did you just say what I think you said? Because it literally makes no sense and my mind can&#x2019;t process it right now, so I&#x2019;m going to have to ask you to repeat it.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the kind of thing you might say when your dad comes home bleeding and tells you that someone hacked him up with an axe.<br> <br>(This really happened, people. I can&#x2019;t make this up.)<br> <br>The second word is: &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>This is pronounced with a silent &#x201c;t,&#x201d; and it generally follows a few seconds after a Huh.

Arthur Young&#39;s Theory of Process provides a model for the evolution of consciousness out of light (the quantum of action), offering hope for an age in search of value and meaning. This is a facsimile of the original 1976 Delacorte edition, with typographic corrections in the text and a new introduction by Huston Smith.</p><p>Arthur Middleton Young (1905-1995) was the son of Eliza Coxe and the Philadelphia landscape painter Charles Morris Young. Born in Paris, he attended Haverford School and then earned a degree in mathematics from Princeton. Always intrigued by the challenges of invention, in 1929 he selected the development of the helicopter as his first career goal. For twelve years he worked alone, using small models to test his ideas, until Bell Aircraft Company invited him to build full-scale experimental helicopters of his design. On March 8, 1946, his &#34;Bell Model 47&#34; received the first commercial helicopter license ever issued. By this time, he was embarking on a more philosophical quest. After the shock of seeing nuclear weapons used in World War II, he decided that science was in need of a comprehensive paradigm or &#34;unified theory&#34; which would bring to light the moral and spiritual implications of new scientific knowledge, and help guide its use. To this end, he established the Foundation for the Study of Consciousness in 1952 in Philadelphia, sponsoring parapsychological research and publishing an interdisciplinary journal. In 1973, the Institute for the Study of Consciousness was founded in Berkeley, California. Here, he worked with his students, and hosted symposia until his death on May 30, 1995. Arthur Young&#39;s &#34;theory of process&#34; cosmology is presented in his seminal books, THE REFLEXIVE UNIVERSE and THE GEOMETRY OF MEANING, published by Delacorte Press in 1976. In 1984, his helicopter, the Bell 47D1, &#34;an object whose delicate beauty is inseparable from its efficiency,&#34; was placed on exhibit as part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York."Science as usually interpreted does not provide for consciousness. Accordingly, there has arisen a conflict between science and religious thought, a conflict which is frequently dismissed because, it is said, science is not concerned with final issues. Such an interpretation of science has invaded other areas. This is particularly true of the social and human sciences, such as psychology. Here it is difficult to understand how we can have a valid science of man, if that science does not recognize final causes, since for man final causes are of the greatest significance. They are, in fact, the touchstone of his behavior. They inspire his works, his goals, his reponsibilities to his fellows. <p>"We have a situation in which science, modestly disclaiming any knowledge of the ultimate issues and sticking to its requirement of particles operated on by forces, has become the model. This model has in turn become the ideal of the psychologists who, dismissing all subtlety of the psyche as 'metaphysical,' create their image of man as a biological machine which can have no mind that is not brain, and no psyche that is not explicable as chemical activity, simply because, in their view, the laws of physics do not recognize any other fundamental ingredients on which to draw. This being so, we can no longer forgo an invasion of the inner sanctum of science to see if it is indeed true that the universe contains nothing but billiard balls (particles, drives, response mechanisms, etc.)."</p></p><h2>The Gone-Away World</h2><p><b>About the 'neon fuzz': a note on the book jacket from designer Jason Booher...</b><br><br>"When you read Harkaway's novel, a gigantic sense of weirdness and cool and doom surround the characters.

I was bent over the pool table with one hand in the bald patch behind the D, which Flynn the Barman claimed was beer, but which was the same size and shape as Mrs. Flynn the Barman's arse: nigh on a yard in the beam and formed like the cross-section of a cooking apple. The fluorescent over the table blinked out, then came back, and the glass-fronted fridge gave a low, lurching hum. The wiring buzzed&#x2014;and then it was dark. A faint sheen of static danced on the TV on its shelf, and the green exit lamp sputtered by the door.<br><br>I dropped my weight into the imprint of Mrs. Flynn the Barman's hams and played the shot anyway. The white ball whispered across the felt, came off two cushions, and clipped the eight cleanly into a side pocket. Doff, doff, tchk . . . glonk. It was perfect. On the other hand, I'd been aiming for the six. I'd given the game to Jim Hepsobah, and any time now when the power came back and everything was normal in the Nameless Bar, I'd pass the cue to my hero pal Gonzo, and Jim would beat him too.<br><br>Any time now.<br><br>Except that the lights stayed out, and the hollow glimmer of the TV set faded away. There was a small, quiet moment, the kind you just have time to notice, which makes you feel sad for no good reason. Then Flynn went out back, swearing like billy-o&#x2014;and if your man Billy-O ever met Flynn, if ever there was a cuss-off, a high noon kinduva thing with foul language, I know where my money'd be.<br><br>Flynn hooked up the generator, which God help us was pig-powered. There was the sound of four large, foul-smelling desert swine being yoked to a capstan, a noise pretty much like a minor cavalry war, and then Flynn let loose some of his most abominable profanity at the nearest porker. It looked as if it wanted to vomit and bolted. The others perforce followed it in a slow but steady progression about the capstan, and then pig number one came back around, saw Flynn ready with another dose and tried to stop. Lashed to the crosspiece and bundled along by its three fellows, it found it couldn't, so it gathered its flabcovered self and charged past him at piggy top speed, and the whole cycle accelerated until, with a malodorous, oinking crunch, the generator kicked in, and the television lit up with the bad news.<br><br>Or rather, it didn't light up. The picture was so dim that it seemed the set was broken. Then there were fireworks and cries of alarm and fear, very quiet but getting louder, and we realised Sally Culpepper was just now turning on the sound. The image shook and veered, and urgent men went past shouting get back, get clear, and ohshitlookatthatfuckerjesus, which they didn't even bother to bleep. In the middle distance, it looked as if maybe a figure was rolling on the ground. Something had gone absolutely, horribly awry in the world, and naturally some arsehole was present with a camera making himself 10k an hour hazard pay when he could have been rolling up his arsehole sleeves and saving a life or two. I knew a guy in the Go Away War who did just that, dumped the network's prized Digi VII in a latrine trench and hauled six civilians and a sergeant from a burning medical truck. Got the Queen's Honour back home and a P45 from his boss. He's in an institution now, is Micah Monroe, and every day two guys from the Veterans' Hospital come by and take him for a walk and make sure the medal's polished on its little stand by his bed. They're sweet old geezers, Harry and Hoyle, and they've got medals of their own and they figure it's the least they can do for a man who lost his mind to giving a damn. Harry's kid was in the medical truck, you see. One of the ones Micah couldn't reach.<br><br>We stared at the screen and tried to make sense of what was on it. It looked, for a moment, as if the Jorgmund Pipe was on fire&#x2014;but that was like saying the sky was falling. The Pipe was the most solidly constructed, triple-redundant, safety-first, one-of-a-kind necessary object in the world. We built it fast and dirty, because there was no other way, the gone-away world and then after that we made it indestructible. The plans were drawn up by the best, then checked and re-checked by the very best, and then the checkers themselves were scrutinised, analysed and vetted for any sign of fifth columnism or martyr tendencies, or even a serious and hitherto undetected case of just-plain-stupid, and then the contractors went to work under a scheme which emphasised thoroughness and adherence to spec over swift completion, and which imposed penalties so dire upon speculators and profiteers that it would actually be safer just to throw yourself from a high place, and finally the quantity surveyors and catastrophe experts went to town on it with hammers and saws, lightning generators and torsion engines, and declared it sound. Everyone in the Livable Zone was united in the desire to maintain and safeguard it. There was absolutely no chance that it could imaginably, conceivably, possibly be on fire.<br><br>It was on fire in a big way. The Pipe was burning painful white, magnesium, corpse-belly, nauseating white, and beside it there were buildings and fences, which meant this wasn't just the Pipe, but something even more important: a pumping station or a refinery. The whole place was wrapped in hot, shining smoke, and deep in the heart of the furnace there was stuff going on the human eye didn't know what to do with, weird, bad-news stuff which came with its own ominous soundtrack. On the screen something very important crumbled into noise and light.<br><br>"Fuuuuuuck," said Gonzo William Lubitsch, speaking for everyone.<br><br>It was a funny feeling: we were looking at the end of the world&#x2014; again&#x2014;and we were looking at something awful we'd never wanted to see, but at the same time we were looking at fame and fortune and just about everything we could ever ask for delivered by a grateful populace. We were looking at our reason for being. Because that thar on that thar screen was a fire, plus also a toxic event of the worst kind, and we, Ladies and Gentlemen, put your hands together, were the Haulage &amp; HazMat Emergency Civil Freebooting Company of Exmoor County (corporate HQ the Nameless Bar, CEO Sally J. Culpepper, presiding) and this was the thing that we did better than anyone else in the entire Livable Zone, and therefore anywhere. Sally was straightaway talking to Jim Hepsobah and then to Gonzo, making lists and giving orders. <br><br>She set Flynn the Barman to brewing his chews-through-steel espresso, and at last even Mrs. Flynn was up off her on-board cushions and moving at flank speed to make provisions, prepare tallies, and take letters for loved ones and estranged ones and people glimpsed and admired across the floating ash of the Nameless Bar. We ran to and fro and bumped into one another and swore, mostly because we didn't have anything important to do yet, and there was hubbub and brouhaha until Sally jumped up on the pool table and told us to shut up and get it together. She raised her phone above our heads like the thigh bone of a saint.<br><br>Sally Culpepper was six feet tall and much of her was leg, and on her right shoulder blade she had an orchid tattoo inked by some kid a quarter-inch shy of Michelangelo. She had strawberry lips and creamy skin and freckles across her nose where it'd been rebuilt after a bar fight in Lisbon. Gonzo claimed to have slept with her, to have had those legs wrapped around his hips like conjoined Italian calf-skin boa constrictors. He said she left him all but dead and grinning like a crescent moon. He said it happened one night after a big job, beer running from the rafters and everyone shiny as an egg yolk with success and soap-scoured skin. He said it was that time when Jim and Sally were trying not to be a thing, before they just gave in to the inevitable and got a place together. Every time we all met up, me and Gonzo and Sally and Jim Hepsobah and the others, Gonzo'd throw her a wicked grin and ask her how her other tattoo was, and Sally Culpepper would smile a secret smile which said she wasn't telling, and maybe he knew what that other tattoo looked like and maybe he didn't. Jim Hepsobah just pretended he hadn't heard, because Jim loved Gonzo like a brother, and love like that recognises that your buddy can be an ass, and doesn't care. We all loved Sally Culpepper, and she ruled us with her transparent lashes and her milkmaid's face and her slender arms that could drop a punch on you like a steam hammer. So there she stood, and there was a reasonable facsimile of calm and attention, because we knew that if the call came it would come on that phone, and we knew she had five-offive reception here, and that was one of the reasons why the Nameless Bar was our place of business.<br><br>So we stopped hunting for lost socks and packing bags, and fretting that we'd somehow miss the starting gun, and settled in to Mrs. Flynn's provender. After a while we got quietly chatty and talked about small domestic chores, like cleaning gutters and chasing bats out of the loft. When the phone did ring (any time now), we could go and be heroes and save the world, which was Gonzo's favourite thing, and perforce something I did from time to time as well. Until it kicked off, we might as well not fuss. And then the Nameless Bar went quiet again; in little groups and one by one we fell silent as we beheld a vision of awful destiny.<br><br>The vision took the form of a small child carrying a snot-crusted and elderly teddy bear. It marched out into the room with much gravitas, surveyed us all sternly, then turned to Mrs. Flynn the Barman to gather in details for the prosecution.<br><br>"Why was it all dark?" it demanded.<br><br>"The power went out," Mrs. Flynn the Barman said cheerfully.<br><br>"There's a fire." The child glowered around the room.<br><br>"These are loud men," it said, still annoyed, "and this one is dirty."<br><br>It indicated Gonzo, who winced. It considered Sally Culpepper.<br><br>"This lady has a flower on her...</p><h2>Citizen Cohn</h2><p>Based on interviews with family, colleagues, and friends, this biography offers a comprehensive portrait of Roy Cohn, his ideological passions, personal life, and patterns of power and money</p><p>$19.95. biog Roy Cohn was not so much a lawyer as an operator. All his life, he preferred manipulating connections with the rich and powerful to playing by the rules diligently. von Hoffman's biography is a fuller and more damning account than Sidney Zion's The Autobiography of Roy Cohn ( LJ 4/15/88), but it is fair; the extensive testimony from friends and foes alike make this almost an oral history. The chapter on Cohn's Washington years as counsel to Senator Joe McCarthy seems curiously out of focus, but the narrative quickly picks up steam as it details the indictments by Bobby Kennedy's Justice Department, the glory years as New York power broker, and finally disbarment and death from AIDS. This fascinating story of a figure at once brilliant and outrageous is highly recommended for public libraries.

Along the way, it also tries to figure out how such a simple question could ever have gotten so complicated. As a culture we seem to have arrived at a place where whatever native wisdom we may once have possessed about eating has been replaced by confusion and anxiety. Somehow this most elemental of activities&#x2014;figuring out what to eat&#x2014;has come to require a remarkable amount of expert help. How did we ever get to a point where we need investigative journalists to tell us where our food comes from and nutritionists to determine the dinner menu?</p><p>For me the absurdity of the situation became inescapable in the fall of 2002, when one of the most ancient and venerable staples of human life abruptly disappeared from the American dinner table. I&#x2019;m talking of course about bread. Virtually overnight, Americans changed the way they eat. A collective spasm of what can only be described as carbophobia seized the country, supplanting an era of national lipophobia dating to the Carter administration. That was when, in 1977, a Senate committee had issued a set of &#x201c;dietary goals&#x201d; warning beef-loving Americans to lay off the red meat. And so we dutifully had done, until now.</p><p>What set off the sea change? It appears to have been a perfect media storm of diet books, scientific studies, and one timely magazine article. The new diet books, many of them inspired by the formerly discredited Dr. Robert C. Atkins, brought Americans the welcome news that they could eat more meat and lose weight just so long as they laid off the bread and pasta. These high-protein, low-carb diets found support in a handful of new epidemiological studies suggesting that the nutritional orthodoxy that had held sway in America since the 1970s might be wrong. It was not, as official opinion claimed, fat that made us fat, but the carbohydrates we&#x2019;d been eating precisely in order to stay slim. So conditions were ripe for a swing of the dietary pendulum when, in the summer of 2002, the New York Times Magazine published a cover story on the new research entitled &#x201c;What if Fat Doesn&#x2019;t Make You Fat?&#x201d; Within months, supermarket shelves were restocked and restaurant menus rewritten to reflect the new nutritional wisdom. The blamelessness of steak restored, two of the most wholesome and uncontroversial foods known to man&#x2014;bread and pasta&#x2014;acquired a moral stain that promptly bankrupted dozens of bakeries and noodle firms and ruined an untold number of perfectly good meals.</p><p>So violent a change in a culture&#x2019;s eating habits is surely the sign of a national eating disorder. Certainly it would never have happened in a culture in possession of deeply rooted traditions surrounding food and eating. But then, such a culture would not feel the need for its most august legislative body to ever deliberate the nation&#x2019;s &#x201c;dietary goals&#x201d;&#x2014;or, for that matter, to wage political battle every few years over the precise design of an official government graphic called the &#x201c;food pyramid.&#x201d; A country with a stable culture of food would not shell out millions for the quackery (or common sense) of a new diet book every January. It would not be susceptible to the pendulum swings of food scares or fads, to the apotheosis every few years of one newly discovered nutrient and the demonization of another. It would not be apt to confuse protein bars and food supplements with meals or breakfast cereals with medicines. It probably would not eat a fifth of its meals in cars or feed fully a third of its children at a fast-food outlet every day. And it surely would not be nearly so fat.</p><p>Nor would such a culture be shocked to discover that there are other countries, such as Italy and France, that decide their dinner questions on the basis of such quaint and unscientific criteria as pleasure and tradition, eat all manner of &#x201c;unhealthy&#x201d; foods, and, lo and behold, wind up actually healthier and happier in their eating than we are. We show our surprise at this by speaking of something called the &#x201c;French paradox,&#x201d; for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substances as foie gras and triple cr�me cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are? Yet I wonder if it doesn&#x2019;t make more sense to speak in terms of an American paradox&#x2014;that is, a notably unhealthy people obsessed by the idea of eating healthily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TO ONE DEGREE or another, the question of what to have for dinner assails every omnivore, and always has. When you can eat just about anything nature has to offer, deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety, especially when some of the potential foods on offer are liable to sicken or kill you. This is the omnivore&#x2019;s dilemma, noted long ago by writers like Rousseau and Brillat-Savarin and first given that name thirty years ago by a University of Pennsylvania research psychologist named Paul Rozin. I&#x2019;ve borrowed his phrase for the title of this book because the omnivore&#x2019;s dilemma turns out to be a particularly sharp tool for understanding our present predicaments surrounding food.</p><p>In a 1976 paper called &#x201c;The Selection of Foods by Rats, Humans, and Other Animals&#x201d; Rozin contrasted the omnivore&#x2019;s existential situation with that of the specialized eater, for whom the dinner question could not be simpler. The koala doesn&#x2019;t worry about what to eat: If it looks and smells and tastes like a eucalyptus leaf, it must be dinner. The koala&#x2019;s culinary preferences are hardwired in its genes. But for omnivores like us (and the rat) a vast amount of brain space and time must be devoted to figuring out which of all the many potential dishes nature lays on are safe to eat. We rely on our prodigious powers of recognition and memory to guide us away from poisons (Isn&#x2019;t that the mushroom that made me sick last week?) and toward nutritious plants (The red berries are the juicier, sweeter ones). Our taste buds help too, predisposing us toward sweetness, which signals carbohydrate energy in nature, and away from bitterness, which is how many of the toxic alkaloids produced by plants taste. Our inborn sense of disgust keeps us from ingesting things that might infect us, such as rotten meat. Many anthropologists believe that the reason we evolved such big and intricate brains was precisely to help us deal with the omnivore&#x2019;s dilemma.</p><p>Being a generalist is of course a great boon as well as a challenge; it is what allows humans to successfully inhabit virtually every terrestrial environment on the planet. Omnivory offers the pleasures of variety, too. But the surfeit of choice brings with it a lot of stress and leads to a kind of Manichaean view of food, a division of nature into The Good Things to Eat, and The Bad.</p><p>The rat must make this all-important distinction more or less on its own, each individual figuring out for itself&#x2014;and then remembering&#x2014;which things will nourish and which will poison. The human omnivore has, in addition to his senses and memory, the incalculable advantage of a culture, which stores the experience and accumulated wisdom of countless human tasters before him. I don&#x2019;t need to experiment with the mushroom now called, rather helpfully, the &#x201c;death cap,&#x201d; and it is common knowledge that that first intrepid lobster eater was on to something very good. Our culture codifies the rules of wise eating in an elaborate structure of taboos, rituals, recipes, manners, and culinary traditions that keep us from having to reenact the omnivore&#x2019;s dilemma at every meal.</p><p>One way to think about America&#x2019;s national eating disorder is as the return, with an almost atavistic vengeance, of the omnivore&#x2019;s dilemma. The cornucopia of the American supermarket has thrown us back on a bewildering food landscape where we once again have to worry that some of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. (Perhaps not as quickly as a poisonous mushroom, but just as surely.) Certainly the extraordinary abundance of food in America complicates the whole problem of choice. At the same time, many of the tools with which people historically managed the omnivore&#x2019;s dilemma have lost their sharpness here&#x2014;or simply failed. As a relatively new nation drawn from many different immigrant populations, each with its own culture of food, Americans have never had a single, strong, stable culinary tradition to guide us.</p><p>The lack of a steadying culture of food leaves us especially vulnerable to the blandishments of the food scientist and the marketer, for whom the omnivore&#x2019;s dilemma is not so much a dilemma as an opportunity. It is very much in the interest of the food industry to exacerbate our anxieties about what to eat, the better to then assuage them with new products. Our bewilderment in the supermarket is no accident; the return of the omnivore&#x2019;s dilemma has deep roots in the modern food industry, roots that, I found, reach all the way back to fields of corn growing in places like Iowa.</p><p>And so we find ourselves where we do, confronting in the supermarket or at the dinner table the dilemmas of omnivorousness, some of them ancient and others never before imagined. The organic apple or the conventional? And if the organic, the local one or the imported? The wild fish or the farmed? The trans fats or the butter or the &#x201c;not butter&#x201d;? Shall I be a carnivore or a vegetarian? And if a vegetarian, a lacto-vegetarian or a vegan? Like the hunter-gatherer picking a novel mushroom off the forest floor and consulting his sense memory to determine its edibility, we pick up the package in the supermarket and, no longer so confident of our senses, scrutinize the label, scratching our heads over the meaning of phrases like &#x201c;heart healthy,&#x201d; &#x201c;no trans fats,&#x201d; &#x201c;cage-free,&#x201d; or &#x201c;range-fed.&#x201d; What is &#x201c;natural grill flavor&#x201d; or TBHQ or xanthan gum? What is all this stuff, anyway, and where in the world did it come from?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MY WAGER in writing The Omnivore&#x2019;s Dilemma was that the best way to answer the questions we face about what to eat was to go back to the very beginning, to follow the food chains that sustain us, all the way from the earth to the plate&#x2014;to a small number of actual meals. I wanted to look at the getting and eating of food at its most fundamental, which is to say, as a transaction between species in nature, eaters and eaten. (&#x201c;The whole of nature,&#x201d; wrote the English author William Ralph Inge, &#x201c;is a conjugation of the verb to eat, in the active and passive.&#x201d;) What I try to do in this book is approach the dinner question as a naturalist might, using the long lenses of ecology and anthropology, as well as the shorter, more intimate lens of personal experience.</p><p>My premise is that like every other creature on earth, humans take part in a food chain, and our place in that food chain, or web, determines to a considerable extent what kind of creature we are. The fact of our omnivorousness has done much to shape our nature, both body (we possess the omnicompetent teeth and jaws of the omnivore, equally well suited to tearing meat and grinding seeds) and soul. Our prodigious powers of observation and memory, as well as our curious and experimental stance toward the natural world, owe much to the biological fact of omnivorousness. So do the various adaptations we&#x2019;ve evolved to defeat the defenses of other creatures so that we might eat them, including our skills at hunting and cooking with fire. Some philosophers have argued that the very open-endedness of human appetite is responsible for both our savagery and civility, since a creature that could conceive of eating anything (including, notably, other humans) stands in particular need of ethical rules, manners, and rituals. We are not only what we eat, but how we eat, too.</p><p>Yet we are also different from most of nature&#x2019;s other eaters&#x2014;markedly so. For one thing, we&#x2019;ve acquired the ability to substantially modify the food chains we depend on, by means of such revolutionary technologies as cooking with fire, hunting with tools, farming, and food preservation. Cooking opened up whole new vistas of edibility by rendering various plants and animals more digestible, and overcoming many of the chemical defenses other species deploy against being eaten. Agriculture allowed us to vastly multiply the populations of a few favored food species, and therefore in turn our own. And, most recently, industry has allowed us to reinvent the human food chain, from the synthetic fertility of the soil to the microwaveable can of soup designed to fit into a car&#x2019;s cup holder. The implications of this last revolution, for our health and the health of the natural world, we are still struggling to grasp.</p><p>The Omnivore&#x2019;s Dilemma is about the three principal food chains that sustain us today: the industrial, the organic, and the hunter-gatherer. Different as they are, all three food chains are systems for doing more or less the same thing: linking us, through what we eat, to the fertility of the earth and the energy of the sun. It might be hard to see how, but even a Twinkie does this&#x2014;constitutes an engagement with the natural world. As ecology teaches, and this book tries to show, it&#x2019;s all connected, even the Twinkie.</p><p>Ecology also teaches that all life on earth can be viewed as a competition among species for the solar energy captured by green plants and stored in the form of complex carbon molecules. A food chain is a system for passing those calories on to species that lack the plant&#x2019;s unique ability to synthesize them from sunlight. One of the themes of this book is that the industrial revolution of the food chain, dating to the close of World War II, has actually changed the fundamental rules of this game. Industrial agriculture has supplanted a complete reliance on the sun for our calories with something new under the sun: a food chain that draws much of its energy from fossil fuels instead. (Of course, even that energy originally came from the sun, but unlike sunlight it is finite and irreplaceable.) The result of this innovation has been a vast increase in the amount of food energy available to our species; this has been a boon to humanity (allowing us to multiply our numbers), but not an unalloyed one. We&#x2019;ve discovered that an abundance of food does not render the omnivore&#x2019;s dilemma obsolete. To the contrary, abundance seems only to deepen it, giving us all sorts of new problems and things to worry about.</p><p>Each of this book&#x2019;s three parts follows one of the principal human food chains from beginning to end: from a plant, or group of plants, photosynthesizing calories in the sun, all the way to a meal at the dinner end of that food chain. Reversing the chronological order, I start with the industrial food chain, since that is the one that today involves and concerns us the most. It is also by far the biggest and longest. Since monoculture is the hallmark of the industrial food chain, this section focuses on a single plant: Zea mays, the giant tropical grass we call corn, which has become the keystone species of the industrial food chain, and so in turn of the modern diet. This section follows a bushel of commodity corn from the field in Iowa where it grew on its long, strange journey to its ultimate destination in a fast-food meal, eaten in a moving car on a highway in Marin County, California.</p><p>The book&#x2019;s second part follows what I call&#x2014;to dis...</p></p><h2>Geary&#39;s Guide to the World&#39;s Great Aphorists</h2><p><p>Both an expert and a collector, James Geary has devoted his life to aphorisms-and the last few years to organizing, indexing, and even translating them. The result is Geary's Guide, featuring aphorists like Voltaire, Twain, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Woody Allen, Muhammad Ali, Emily Dickinson, and Mae West, as well as international practitioners appearing in English for the first time. But it is more than just a conventional anthology. It is also an encyclopedia, containing brief biographies of each author in addition to a selection of his or her aphorisms. The book is a field guide, too, with aphorists organized into eight different "species," such as Comics, Critics &amp; Satirists; Icons &amp; Iconoclasts; and Painters &amp; Poets. The book's two indexes-by author and by subject-make it easily searchable, while its unique organizational structure and Geary's lively biographical entries set it apart from all previous reference works. <br>A perfect follow-up to Geary's <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The World in a Phrase</i>, Geary's Guide is eminently suitable for browsing or for sustained reading. A comprehensive guide to our most intimate, idiosyncratic literary form, the book is an indispensable tool for writers and public speakers as well as essential reading for all language lovers. </p><br><p>PRAISE: </p><br><p>"...a wonderful breviary of wisdom, insight and cynicism, and one that will immediately find a place at many bedsides...there are pleasures and surprises galore."-<i>Washington</i><i> Post</i> <br>"An agreeable thing to have in your lap."-Dwight Garner <br>"<i>Geary's Guide to the World's Great Aphorists</i> is a rich, well-edited compendium, which is at once a feast, a frolic, a thought-kit and a treasure trove.

The rock simply parted around the animal, like some sort of revelation. I was left holding two pieces of rock--surely what I held was the textbook come alive. The long thin eyes of the trilobite regarded me and I returned the gaze. More compelling than any pair of blue eyes, there was a shiver of recognition across 500 million years."<br><br>From the author of Life comes the fascinating story of the beginnings of life on our planet as seen by its very first creatures, trilobites--the exotic, crustacean-like animals that dominated the seas for 300 million years.<br>Richard Fortey fell in love with trilobites as a fourteen-year-old when he held his first fossil in his hand. In Trilobite!, he draws on a lifetime of study of these creatures to unravel the history of life on earth from their point of view. Trilobites saw continents move, mountain chains grow and erode; they survived ice ages and volcanic eruptions, constantly evolving and exquisitely adapting to their environment--their own evolution calibrated to geological time itself.<br>With Fortey's expert guidance, we begin to understand how trilobites reveal the pattern and mechanism of evolution through their fossil legacy in the rocks. Through the eyes of trilobites, he allows us glimpses of former worlds as foreign in their geography as in their life forms. Altogether, he provides a unique picture of our geological past, which in turn provides us--scientist and layperson alike--with a new grasp of the wonders of scientific discovery.</p><p>With his new book <i>Trilobite! Eyewitness to Evolution</i>, Richard Fortey confirms his status as one of the best communicators of science around today. His hugely enjoyable previous book, <i>Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth</i>, was shortlisted for the 1998 Rhone-Poulenc science book prize, but <i>Trilobite!</i> is sure to receive even greater acclaim. Whereas <i>Life</i> took the reader on a whistle-stop tour of evolution from start to present--a huge undertaking that necessarily granted little space to each time period or taxonomic group--<i>Trilobite!</i> sees Fortey indulging in a whole book about his overriding paleontological passion, the long extinct and enigmatic creatures of the title. The result is a joy.<p> Trilobites--woodlicelike creatures that dominated the world's oceans long before the time of the dinosaurs--are, arguably, the most beautiful animals that have ever been chipped out of the fossil record. Fortey certainly seems to think so. His enthusiastic, almost loving explanations of the anatomy, ecology, and long evolutionary history of these fascinating vanished creatures carry the reader on an inspirational journey into the Earth's distant past. But the book is much more than a technical treatise on trilobites. We learn about Fortey himself, his formative years as an amateur then professional paleontologist, about his much-loved teachers and colleagues, and above all, about that strange but addictive pastime known as science. You may not find arthropods as charming as Fortey does, but you will not fail to be charmed by the author. A delightful read. <i>--Chris Lavers, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"In Richard Fortey's capable hands the humble gray trilobite has been transformed into the E.T. of the Lower Palaeozoic - a lovable and highly instructive animal, amply deserving of the enthusiasm and affection with which it is memorialized in this remarkable and fascinating book." <br>-- Simon Winchester, author of <i>The Professor and the Madman</i><br><br>"This is the way science should be written: so engagingly that it makes you forget that you're actually learning something (actually, you're learning a lot), and carrying you swiftly from page to page so that before you know it, you've let the kettle boil over and you're at the end, where the 'suggested reading' list shows you that Fortey has read practically everything about trilobites so that he could condense it here for you, and make you feel that if it's not too late, you'd better call him up at the National History Museum and see if he needs an assistant in the trilobite section. If I had five thousand words I couldn't do <b>Trilobite!</b> justice. There's just no way to condense Fortey's glittering book so filled with insight, science, history, charm and wit. The book speaks brilliantly for itself.

Tour.</p><p>Colleen McCullough is the internationally acclaimed author of seven previous novels: <i>The Thorn Birds, An Indecent Obsession, A Creed for the Third Millenium, The Ladies of Missalonghi, The First Man in Rome, The Grass Crown,</i> and <i>Fortune's Favorites.</i> She lives with her husband, Ric Robinson, on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific.Senator and debtor, general and seducer, orator and would-be world conqueror, Julius Caesar, as depicted in this fourth installment (after Fortune's Favorites) in McCullough's epic re-creation of ancient Rome, is both a force of nature and something of a momma's boy. He worships his sophisticated mother Aurelia, "a fount of experience and a mine of common sense," while dismissing as "not important" his "expensive, idle, and monumentally silly" second wife, Pompeia. Its title notwithstanding, this marvelously researched and detailed novel focuses on traditional male pursuits-political intrigue, war, conquest-in the corruption-riddled late Roman republic even as it elucidates the behind-the-scenes influence of women in a repressively patriarchal society. Caesar, though tenderly loving and protective toward his daughter, Julia, pledges her as a child to the adolescent Brutus, with whose mother-the cruel, scheming Servilia-the future dictator of Rome has a purely sexual affair. Years later, Caesar cancels the betrothal in order to use his blossoming daughter as bait to forge a political alliance with the commander of the Roman legions. Meanwhile, Cicero, Caesar's main rival, is portrayed as an incurable vacillator and social climber who displays scant gratitude toward his "sour" and "ugly" wife, Terentia, despite her foiling a conspiracy against his life. With great brio, and ample attention to Roman customs and rites, as well as to the religious, sexual and social institutions of the day, including slavery, McCullough captures the driven, passionate soul of ancient Rome.

Intense, eerie, and instantly compelling, they announce the stunningly fertile imagination of perhaps the greatest storyteller of our time.</p><p>In his introduction to <i>Everything's Eventual</i>, horror author extraordinaire Stephen King describes how he used a deck of playing cards to select the order in which these 14 tales of the macabre would appear. Judging by the impact of these stories, from the first words of the darkly fascinating "Autopsy Room Four" to the haunting final pages of "Luckey Quarter," one can almost believe King truly is guided by forces from beyond.<p> His first collection of short stories since the release of <i>Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes</i> in 1993, <i>Everything's Eventual</i> represents King at his most undiluted. The short story format showcases King's ability to spook readers using the most mundane settings (a yard sale) and comfortable memories (a boyhood fishing excursion). The dark tales collected here are some of King's finest, including an O. Henry Prize winner and "Riding the Bullet," published originally as an e-book and at one time expected by some to be the death knell of the physical publishing world. True to form, each of these stories draws the reader into King's slightly off-center world from the first page, developing characters and atmosphere more fully in the span of 50 pages than many authors can in a full novel.</p><p> For most rabid King fans, chief among the tales in this volume will be "The Little Sisters of Eluria," a novella that first appeared in the fantasy collection <i>Legends</i>, set in King's ever-expanding Dark Tower universe. In this story, set prior to the first Dark Tower volume, the reader finds Gunslinger Roland of Gilead wounded and under the care of nurses with very dubious intentions. Also included in this collection are "That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French," the story of a woman's personal hell; "1408," in which a writer of haunted tour guides finally encounters the real thing; "Everything's Eventual," the title story, about a boy with a dream job that turns out to be more of a nightmare; and "L.T.'s Theory of Pets," a story of divorce with a bloody surprise ending.</p><p> King also includes an introductory essay on the lost art of short fiction and brief explanatory notes that give the reader background on his intentions and inspirations for each story. As with any occasion when King directly addresses his dear Constant Readers, his tone is that of a camp counselor who's almost apologetic for the scare his fireside tales are about to throw into his charges, yet unwilling to soften the blow. And any campers gathered around this author's fire would be wise to heed his warnings, for when King goes bump in the night, it's never just a branch on the window. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

The book he came up with is part bemused essay and part mystical treatise--&#34;suchness&#34; is everywhere to be found while under the influence. This is a good example of essay writing, journal keeping, and the value of controversy--always--in one&#39;s work.In 1953, Aldous Huxley took four-tenths of a gram of the drug Mescalin, sat down and waited to see what would happen.

Despommier's stroke of genius, <i>The Vertical Farm</i>, has excited scientists, architects, and politicians around the globe. These farms, grown inside skyscrapers, would provide solutions to many of the serious problems we currently face, including: allowing year-round crop production; providing food to areas currently lacking arable land; immunity to weather-related crop failure; re-use of water collected by de-humidification of the indoor environment; new employment opportunities; no use of pesticides, fertilizers, or herbicides; drastically reduced dependence on fossil fuels; no crop loss due to shipping or storage; no agricultural runoff; and, many more. Vertical farming can be located on abandoned city properties, creating new urban revenue streams. They will employ lots of skilled and unskilled labor. They can be run on wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal energy. They can be used to grow plants for pharmaceutical purposes or for converting gray water back into drinking water. In the tradition of the bestselling <i>The World Without Us</i>, this is a totally original landmark work destined to become a classic. With stunning illustrations and clear and entertaining writing, this book will appeal to anyone concerned about America's future. <p> <strong>A Look Inside <i>Vertical Farm</i> </strong><br><b>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</b> <br> </p> <p></p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td> Pyramid Farm by Eric Ellingsen and Dickson Despommier </td> <td> Urban Farm, Urban Epicenter by Jung Min Nam </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td><td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> The Dragonfly Tower by Vincent Callebaut </td> <td> Harvest Green by Romses Architects </td> </tr> </tbody></table><p>DR.

The proof of their genius is apparent in the mysterious monoliths at Stonehenge, and in a strange but highly significant structure of concentric stone circles in Israel's Golan Heights &#x2013; requiring sophisticated astronomical knowledge. This book illuminates the turning point in our species' history. From deep inside ancient Sumerian texts that predate even the Bible, Zecharia Sitchin dares to reveal the nature of prophecy and historical truths that have long been obscured by disbelief and misunderstanding: the code used to construct our kind by master builder from the stars. </p>One of the charms of Zecharia Sitchin is his tendency to take ancient writings as fact as opposed to myth. For example, according to clay tablets discovered by archeologists, Gilgamesh, a king of ancient Sumeria, was punished by the gods for raping female subjects on their wedding day--a particularly naughty, though not uncommon, pastime of ancient royalty. Snickering, the tricky gods created a double of him, which, as you can imagine, created havoc in the king's life. Some time later, directed by his goddess mother, Gilgamesh walked with his double to Lebanon to attain immortality. Sitchin ponders that perhaps the double had superhuman strength and en route built a second Stonehenge discovered in the Golan Heights by Israelis during the 1967 Six Days War. Hmmm. As Sitchin concedes, there's really no way to tell who actually built this hoary structure, but the in-depth archeological and historical research gathered here to support his musings concerning an extraterrestrial secret code to construct humankind is fascinating beyond belief. <i>--P.

They live in Ashland, OR.<b>From: Dare to Prepare!</b><br> <br>SERGEI: Often, when teaching food preparation classes, I notice that most of my students cling to recipes and request exact proportions of ingredients. Even though raw-food recipes are particularly flexible and experimentation can even improve the recipe, students still hesitate to take a playful approach with food preparation. For example, when I demonstrate how to make a green smoothie, I often use a combination of spinach, mango, and water, because these ingredients are readily available and excitingly delicious. However, in one workshop I was unable to find these ingredients and had to substitute with bananas and kale. My students loved the smoothie and requested the recipe. I made a point to mention that there are tastier recipes for a green smoothie; however, it seems my words fell on deaf ears, because months later I still received e-mails from people who, in fear of trying anything new, exclusively drank the banana/kale smoothie. To my surprise, most of my students did not stray from that recipe. While I can understand the fear behind attempting something new (there&#x2019;s the chance of wasting time and ingredients, and getting unsatisfying results), raw recipes allow much room to experiment, often improving the dish.<br> <br>Every individual&#x2014;whether man, woman, or child&#x2014;is an amazingly powerful being, capable of happiness and health. We were built with a brain, a fabulous body, and an intuition to use as tools that aid us in our growth. When properly used, these tools have the power to enhance an individual&#x2019;s existence in the best, most productive way. We are not taught early enough how to use what we were given, which is why we cling to rules, regulations, and expert opinions. As with any tangible, physical tool that can be held in our hands, our intangible, invisible instruments cannot help us unless we begin to use them. I propose that, together, we begin activating these powers; for they are our maps to life.<br> <br>There are certain laws that we need to follow to maintain order in our lives. Likewise, there are many that can be disregarded. Changing a recipe a bit doesn&#x2019;t hurt anyone. By adding one extra pinch of cumin to make a better-tasting cracker, we can practice conversing with our inner selves, thereby expanding our comfort zones. I have found that the more I experiment, the more comfortable I become with using my invisible tools, and thus the more empowered I become.<br> <br>We live in a society that has either forgotten the value of empowered people or simply strives to suppress individuals from manifesting their strength. Today&#x2019;s society is so destructive that people no longer feel strong or comfortable enough to rely on themselves. Our educational system has us convinced that we cannot function successfully without help from authority figures. The current educational system grabs children at an early age and begins educating them to properly conform and comply with orders from people who are older, smarter, and more experienced than they. Instead of helping our children develop a sense of independence, we hand them off to their first kindergarten teachers and instruct them to listen to the educator because he or she has many years of training and therefore knows best. Thus, we come to learn that our bones cannot be strong without milk or healthy without meat, and that chemical fertilizers enrich food quality, as well as countless other myths that we cling to until our dying days.<br> <br>If we live our lives believing that we are incapable of creating even a simple raw recipe on our own, then how can we do anything that requires more responsibility? I remember one instance when I was scheduled to demonstrate how to make carob truffles but was notified moments before class that none of my recipe ingredients had been delivered. I quickly ran to the kitchen, grabbed whatever I could find, and proceeded to demonstrate making truffles with ingredients I had never used before. My heart pounded anxiously as I passed out samples to a crowd of fifty, hoping my concoction didn&#x2019;t taste horribly bad. To my surprise, the room resonated with audible <i>yum</i>&#x2019;s and <i>wow</i>&#x2019;s. Everyone was ecstatic. The &#x201c;Sweet and Sour Coconut Truffles&#x201d; recipe I invented that day is in the dessert section of this book (page 111). However, don&#x2019;t let this recipe limit your imagination.<br> <br>Relying on yourself is fun and refreshing! The more I rely on myself, the more surprised I am at not only how easy it is but also how quickly I master things I never suspected I could. I encourage you to use the recipes in this book merely as a guide to creating your own cuisine.</p><h2>OUT STEALING HORSES</h2><p>Winner of the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.In 1948, when he is fifteen, Trond spends a summer in the country with his father. The events &#x20ac;&#x201d; the accidental death of a child, his best friend&#x20ac;&#x2122;s feelings of guilt and eventual disappearance, his father&#x20ac;&#x2122;s decision to leave the family for another woman &#x20ac;&#x201d; will change his life forever. An early morning adventure out stealing horses leaves Trond bruised and puzzled by his friend Jon&#x20ac;&#x2122;s sudden breakdown. The tragedy that lies behind this scene becomes the catalyst for the two boys&#x20ac;&#x2122; families to gradually fall apart. As a 67-year-old man, and following the death of his wife, Trond has moved to an isolated part of Norway to live in solitude. But a chance encounter with a character from the fateful summer of 1948 brings the painful memories of that year flooding back, and will leave Trond even more convinced of his decision to end his days alone.Per Petterson, defeated eight finalists, incl</p><p>Per Petterson was born in 1952 and was a librarian and a bookseller before he published his first work, a volume of short stories, in 1987.

It's where he last saw his father at the end of summer 1948. Then 15 and full grown, Trond helped harvest the timber&#x2014;too early, perhaps, but necessarily, it came to seem later. He also suddenly lost his local best friend, Jon, when, after an early morning spent "stealing horses"&#x2014;that is, taking an equine joyride&#x2014;Jon inadvertently allowed a gun accident that killed one of his 10-year-old twin brothers and guiltily ran away to sea. When that summer was over, Trond went back to Oslo, but his father stayed with Jon's mother, his lover since they met in the Resistance during World War II. Segueing with aplomb between his present and past, Trond's own narration is literarily distinguished, arguably to a fault; would a businessman, even one who loves Dickens, write this well? The novel's incidents and lush but precise descriptions of forest and river, rain and snow, sunlight and night skies are on a par with those of Cather, Steinbeck, Berry, and Hemingway, and its emotional force and flavor are equivalent to what those authors can deliver, too.

Introduction by Elie Wiesel.</p><p>It has long been alleged that officials in the Roosevelt administration knew, in surprising detail, about Adolf Hitler's plans to exterminate all the Jews in Nazi Europe--and that these officials did little to prevent the massacre, refusing asylum to shiploads of Jewish refugees and failing to order the bombing of railway lines leading to Auschwitz, Treblinka, and other concentration camps. David S. Wyman examines the evidence, concluding that senior American officials could indeed have saved many thousands, if not millions, of European Jews by intervening earlier. In this controversial work, he suggests, with good cause, that a combination of anti-Semitism and indifference to anything not perceived as being of direct strategic importance to the United States indirectly led to countless deaths. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>This book is to inform the readers of the Jewish dilemma. My book was written to inform the public of the atrocities of the U.S. Government during WWII. The government at the time knew what was going on and did nothing to stop the slaughter of millions of innocent Jews. -- David S. Wyman</p><h2>Resurrection Row</h2><p>What an odd sight! The dead body of a peer of the realm sitting upright in an empty hansom cab. He had been decently buried once before, Inspector Pitt knew. There was something terrible amiss.

Anne Perry lives in Scotland.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>This 1981 mystery, the fourth in the long-running series featuring Inspector Thomas Pitt and his well-born wife, Charlotte, is one of the best for its balance between the mystery itself and Perry's scathing portrait of Victorian society. It is bad enough that the recently deceased Lord Fitzroy-Hammond has been removed from his grave, but when it happens a second time and then other buried corpses start popping up, the normally unflappable Pitt is puzzled indeed. Is the perpetrator trying to hide a murder or call attention to one? The answer lies in a convoluted but perfectly logical merging of art, blackmail, politics, pornography, and prostitution. Perry (Paragon Walk) delights in showing how much of London, except for a handful of influential citizens, chose to ignore the shameful poverty surrounding them.

In fact, plants monitor their visible environment all the time. Plants see if you come near them; they know when you stand over them. They even know if you're wearing a blue or a red shirt. They know if you've painted your house or if you've moved their pots from one side of the living room to the other. Of course plants don't "see" in pictures as you or I do. Plants can't discern between a slightly balding middle-aged man with glasses and a smiling little girl with brown curls. But they do see light in many ways and colors that we can only imagine. Plants see the same ultraviolet light that gives us sunburns and infrared light that heats us up. Plants can tell when there's very little light, like from a candle, or when it's the middle of the day, or when the sun is about to set into the horizon. Plants know if the light is coming from the left, the right, or from above. They know if anotherplant has grown over them, blocking their light. And they know how long the lights have been on. So, can this be considered "plant vision"? Let's first examine what vision is for us. Imagine a person born blind, living in total darkness. Now imagine this person being given the ability to discriminate between light and shadow. This person could differentiate between night and day, inside and outside. These new senses would definitely be considered rudimentary sight and would enable new levels of function. Now imagine this person being able to discern color. She can see blue above and green below. Of course this would be a welcome improvement over darkness or being able to discern only white or gray. I think we can all agree that this fundamental change--from total blindness to seeing color--is definitely "vision" for this person. <i>Merriam-Webster's</i> defines "sight" as "the physical sense by which light stimuli received by the eye are interpreted by the brain and constructed into a representation of the position, shape, brightness, and usually color of objects in space." We see light in what we define as the "visual spectra." Light is a common, understandable synonym for the electromagnetic waves in the visible spectrum. This means that light has properties shared with all other types of electrical signals, such as micro- and radio waves. Radio waves for AM radio are very long, almost half a mile in length. That's why radio antennas are many stories tall. In contrast, X-ray waves are very, very short, one trillion times shorter than radio waves, which is why they pass so easily through our bodies. Light waves are somewhere in the middle, between 0.0000004 and 0.0000007 meter long. Blue light is the shortest, while red light is the longest, with green, yellow, and orange in the middle. (That's why the color pattern of rainbows is alwaysoriented in the same direction--from the colors with short waves, like blue, to the colors with long waves, like red.) These are the electromagnetic waves we "see" because our eyes have special proteins called photoreceptors that know how to receive this energy, to absorb it, the same way that an antenna absorbs radio waves. The retina, the layer at the back of our eyeballs, is covered with rows and rows of these receptors, sort of like the rows and rows of LEDs in flat-screen televisions or sensors in digital cameras. Each point on the retina has photoreceptors called rods, which are sensitive to all light, and photoreceptors called cones, which respond to different colors of light. Each cone or rod responds to the light focused on it. The human retina contains about 125 million rods and 6 million cones, all in an area about the size of a passport photo. That's equivalent to a digital camera with a resolution of 130 megapixels. This huge number of receptors in such a small area gives us our high visual resolution. For comparison, the highest-resolution outdoor LED displays contain only about 10,000 LEDs per square meter, and common digital cameras have a resolution of only about 8 megapixels. Rods are more sensitive to light and enable us to see at night and under low-light conditions but not in color. Cones allow us to see different colors in bright light since cones come in three flavors--red, green, and blue. The major difference between these different photoreceptors is the specific chemical they contain. These chemicals, called rhodopsin in rods and photopsins in cones, have a specific structure that enables them to absorb light of different wavelengths. Blue light is absorbed by rhodopsin and the blue photopsin; red light by rhodopsin and the red photopsin. Purple light is absorbed by rhodopsin, blue photopsin, and red photopsin, but <i>not</i> green photopsin, and so on. Once the rod or cone absorbs the light, it sends a signal to the brain thatprocesses all of the signals from the millions of photoreceptors into a single coherent picture. Blindness results from defects at many stages: from light perception by the retina due to a physical problem in its structure; from the inability to sense the light (because of problems in the rhodopsin and photopsins, for example); or in the ability to transfer the information to the brain. People who are color-blind for red, for example, don't have any red cones. Thus the red signals are not absorbed and passed on to the brain. Human sight involves cells that absorb the light, and the brain then processes this information, which we in turn respond to. So what happens in plants? <i>Darwin the Botanist</i> It's not widely known that for the twenty years following his publication of the landmark <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, Charles Darwin conducted a series of experiments that still influence research in plants to this day. Darwin was fascinated by the effects of light on plant growth, as was his son Francis. In his final book, <i>The Power of Movement in Plants</i>, Darwin wrote: "There are extremely few [plants], of which some part ... does not bend toward lateral light." Or in less verbose modern English: almost all plants bend toward light. We see that happen all the time in houseplants that bow and bend toward rays of sunshine coming in from the window. This behavior is called phototropism. In 1864 a contemporary of Darwin's, Julius von Sachs, discovered that blue light is the primary color that induces phototropism in plants, while plants are generally blind to other colors that have little effect on theirbending toward light. But no one knew at that time how or which part of a plant sees the light coming from a particular direction. In a very simple experiment, Darwin and his son showed that this bending was due not to photosynthesis, the process whereby plants turn light into energy, but rather to some inherent sensitivity to move toward light. For their experiment, the two Darwins grew a pot of canary grass in a totally dark room for several days. Then they lit a very small gas lamp twelve feet from the pot and kept it so dim that they "could not see the seedlings themselves, nor see a pencil line on paper." But after only three hours, the plants had obviously curved toward the dim light. The curving always occurred at the same part of the young plant, an inch or so below the tip. This led them to question which part of the plant saw the light. The Darwins carried out what has become a classic experimentin botany. They hypothesized that the "eyes" of the plant were found at the seedling tip and <i>not</i> at the part of the seedling that bends. They checked phototropism in five different seedlings, illustrated by the following diagram: a. The first seedling was untreated and shows that the conditions of the experiment are conducive to phototropism. b. The second had its tip pruned off. c. The third had its tip covered with a lightproof cap. d. The fourth had its tip covered with a clear glass cap. e. The fifth had its middle section covered by a lightproof tube. They carried out the experiment on these seedlings in the same conditions as their initial experiment, and of course the untreated seedling bent toward the light. Similarly, the seedling with the lightproof tube around its middle (see <i>e</i> above) bent toward the light. If they removed the <i>tip</i> of a seedling, however, or covered it with a lightproof cap, it went blind and couldn't bend toward the light. Then they witnessed the behavior of theplant in scenario four ( <i>d</i>): this seedling continued to bend toward the light even though it had a cap on its tip. The difference here was that the cap was clear. The Darwins realized that the glass still allowed the light to shine onto the tip of the plant. In one simple experiment, published in 1880, the two Darwins proved that phototropism is the result of light hitting the tip of a plant's shoot, which sees the light and transfers this information to the plant's midsection to tell it to bend in that direction. The Darwins had successfully demonstrated rudimentary sight in plants. <i>Maryland Mammoth: The Tobacco That Just Kept Growing</i> Several decades later, a new tobacco strain cropped up in the valleys of southern Maryland and reignited interest in the ways that plants see the world. These valleys have been home to some of America's greatest tobacco farms since the first settlers arrived at the end of the seventeenth century. Tobacco farmers, learning from the Native tribes such as the Susquehannock, who had grown tobacco for centuries, would plant their crop in the spring and harvest it in late summer. Some of the plants weren't harvested for their leaves and made flowers that provided the seed for the next year's crop. In 1906, farmers began to notice a new strain of tobacco that never seemed to stop growing. It could reach fifteen feet in height, produce almost a hundred leaves, and would only stop growing when the frosts set in. On the surface, such a robust, ever-growing plant would seem a boon to tobacco farmers. But as is so often the case, this new strain, aptly named Maryland Mammoth, was like the two-faced Roman god Janus. On the one hand, it never stopped growing; on the other,it rarely flowered, meaning farmers couldn't harvest seed for the next year's crop. In 1918, Wightman W. Garner and Harry A. Allard, two scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, set out to determine why Maryland Mammoth didn't know when to stop making leaves and start making flowers and seeds instead. They planted the Maryland Mammoth in pots and left one group outside in the fields. The other group was put in the field during the day but moved to a dark shed every afternoon. Simply limiting the amount of light the plants saw was enough to cause Maryland Mammoth to stop growing and start flowering. In other words, if Maryland Mammoth was exposed to the long days of summer, itwould keep growing leaves. But if it experienced artificially shorter days, then it would flower. This phenomenon, called photoperiodism, gave us the first strong evidence that plants measure how much light they take in. Other experiments over the years have revealed that many plants, just like the Mammoth, flower only if the day is short; they are referred to as "short-day" plants. Such short-day plants include chrysanthemums and soybeans. Some plants need a long day to flower; irises and barley are considered "long-day" plants. This discovery meant that farmers could now manipulate flowering to fit their schedules by controlling the light that a plant sees. It's not surprising that farmers in Florida soon figured out that they could grow Maryland Mammoth for many months (without the effects of frost encountered in Maryland) and that the plants would eventually flower in the fields in midwinter when the days were shortest. <i>What a Difference a (Short) Day Makes</i> The concept of photoperiodism sparked a rush of activity among scientists who were brimming with follow-up questions: Do plants measure the length of the day or the night? And what color of light are plants seeing? Around the time of World War II, scientists discovered that they could manipulate when plants flowered simply by quickly turning the lights on and off in the middle of the night. They could take a short-day plant like the soybean and keep it from making flowers in short days if they turned on the lights for only a few minutes in the middle of the night. On the other hand, the scientists could cause a long-day plant like the iris to makeflowers even in the middle of the winter (during short days, when it shouldn't normally flower), if in the middle of the night they turned on the lights for just a few moments. These experiments proved that what a plant measures is not the length of the <i>day</i> but the length of the continuous period of darkness. Using this technique, flower farmers can keep chrysanthemums from flowering until just before Mother's Day, which is the optimal time to have them burst onto the spring flower scene. Chrysanthemum farmers have a problem since Mother's Day comes in the spring but the flowers normally blossom in the fall as the days get shorter. Fortunately, chrysanthemums grown in greenhouses can be kept from flowering by turning on the lights for a few minutes at night throughout the fall and winter. Then ... <i>boom ...</i> two weeks before Mother's Day, the farmers stop turning on the lights at night, and all the plants start to flower at once, ready for harvest and shipping. These scientists were curious about the color of light that the plants saw. What they discovered was surprising: the plants, and it didn't matter which ones were tested, only responded to a flash of red during the night. Blue or green flashes during the night wouldn't influence when the plant flowered, but only a few seconds of <i>red</i> would. Plants were differentiating between colors: they were using blue light to know which direction to bend in and red light to measure the length of the night. Then, in the early 1950s, Harry Borthwick and his colleagues in the USDA lab where Maryland Mammoth was first studied made the amazing discovery that far-red light--light that has wavelengths that are a bit longer than bright red and is most often seen, just barely, at dusk--could cancel the effect of the red light on plants. Let me spell this out more clearly: if you takeirises, which normally don't flower in long nights, and give them a shot of red light in the middle of the night, they'll make flowers as bright and as beautiful as any iris in a nature preserve. But if you shine far-red light on them right after the pulse of red, it's as if they never saw the red light to begin with. They won't flower. If you then shine red light on them after the far-red, they will. Hit them again with far-red light, and they won't. And so on. We're also not talking about lots of light; a few seconds of either color is enough. It's like a light-activated switch: The red light turns on flowering; the far-red light turns it off. If you flip the switch back and forth fast enough, nothing happens. On a more philosophical level, we can say that the plant remembers the last color it saw. By the time John F. Kennedy was elected president, Warren L. Butler and colleagues had demonstrated that a single photoreceptor in plants was responsible for both the red and the far-red effects. They called this receptor "phytochrome," meaning "plant color." In its simplest model, phytochrome is the light-activated switch. Red light activates phytochrome, turning it into a form primed to receive far-red light. Far-red light inactivates phyt...</p><h2>The Smoking Gun: Day by Day Through a Shocking Murder Trial with Gerry Spence (Lisa Drew Books)</h2><p>Recounts the dramatic events surrounding the trial of Sandy Jones and her teenage son, who were accused of murdering a real-estate developer, describing the trial&#39;s three-year process of explosive courtroom scenes, class conflicts, and crushing state power. 75,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Gerry Spence</b> has spent a lifetime representing those he calls "the lost, the poor, the powerless, the voiceless, and the damned."

And what happens to the lawyer who defended the poor bastard? If he was worth a damn and cared, a part of him dies along with his client. He drowns in his nightmares. He thinks that if he'd been more competent, prepared better, or called one more witness, maybe he could have saved his client. </p><p> A small-time real estate developer named Wilfred Gerttula was dead -- shot cleanly through the chest. Not only that, the prosecutor had an eyewitness to the murder, the dead man's wife, Monica, who said she'd seen Sandy Jones murder her husband, shoot him point-blank with the gun in the photograph. She ought to know, she said. She took the photograph. Then Monica said this Jones woman drove off with her dying husband in her husband's own pickup. It had been a cold-blooded, premeditated killing. </p><p> Sandy Jones was thirty-nine years old at the time she was arrested. She hadn't lounged in a bed of roses. Out of high school she'd gone to work in a cannery sorting berries. After that she managed one of those small motels that brags with its flickering neon sign that it's "modern," which means it has running water, sometimes. Sandy saw to all of the maintenance, painted, fixed the leaking faucets, and filled in the chuckholes in the driveway. Earlier a drunk driver ran into her, injuring her back and ribs. She and Mike Sr. had had a stormy marriage. He drank. They separated. He quit drinking. They got together again. And during his comings and goings their two kids, Little Mike and Shawn, were seeded and born. </p><p> Big Mike, as the family called him to distinguish him from their young son, Mike Jr., was a broad, muscled man of average height with wavy red hair, a red beard, an outdoor face, and powerful arms. He'd been a fisherman in Alaska, but that was before he'd been hurt working in the woods. After that, to feed his family he fished for salmon in the Siletz River and worked at whatever odd jobs he could find. </p><p> When, in the last days of July 1985, Sandy and Little Mike, by then fifteen, were both charged with murder, Mike Jones was like a lot of folks who face the crushing power of the state. He didn't know what to do; he had to find a lawyer to defend both his wife and son, and he had no money. The Joneses never had much. When their bills weren't paid, the phone company shut their phone off, and sometimes the power company shut off the electricity. They lived on a twenty-nine-acre swamp-bottom farm in a rickety, leaky-roofed house that was little more than a shack with a porch. The boundaries of their small, severely overgrazed pasture were marked by a dilapidated fence, the rotted posts leaning, the wire sagging. Derelict car bodies, rusted and in parts, were strewn here and there along with an assortment of other junk and a couple of outbuildings, one of which served as a barn for the kids' pony and the milk cow, and the other as a well house. The bank's mortgage was attached to the place like a cop's chokehold on a suspect. </p><p> The dead man, Wilfred Gerttula -- in his fifties, tough, grizzled, and humorless -- had insisted that the road that cut through the Jones property was a public road. Little more than a trail, it crowded within six feet of the corner of the Joneses' bedroom and then meandered steeply up a densely forested mountain through fern and heavy undergrowth to some granite outcroppings the Native Americans called Medicine Rock. After that, the trail snaked through the wet Oregon jungle to the top of the mountain and past a wire gate that marked the Joneses' farthest boundary. There a person could look down the steep canyon side to the river a couple hundred feet below. Beyond the Joneses' gate, the trail puttered along to other lands and eventually led to what Gerttula claimed was his subdivision. </p><p> "That's a county road," Gerttula proclaimed. "Always has been. And that woman won't let me or my buyers come through. Stops us cold ever' time." The good old boys of Lincoln County had had some experience with the Jones woman before. She was a troublemaker all right. </p><p> But Sandy Jones made her own speech. "The county and nobody else has ever had any right to cross our land. He says he has a subdivision up there? I can show you it was illegally established. Besides, a public road on that unstable ground would give way in the rainy season. It'd be dangerous." Beyond that, the Indians, with whom she held continual counsel, claimed that Medicine Rock was a sacred Indian burial ground. And Sandy Jones was one who was willing to fight for the rights of her Indian friends. "This is America," she declared, "and the good old boys in Lincoln County are not going to make us give up what rightfully belongs to us." Sandy herself was one-eighth Sioux. </p><p> There'd been lawsuits brought by Gerttula against the Joneses over the road and countersuits by Sandy Jones. Not satisfied with suing the Gerttulas, she sued the judges and the prosecuting attorney himself. Her first half-dozen attorneys dropped her, mostly because she couldn't pay, but she blindly forged on representing herself. </p><p> After the shooting on that muggy July day in 1985, and in panic, Sandy Jones had driven the Gerttula pickup down the mountain to get help for Gerttula, who was doubled up in the seat next to her. He was dead when she parked the truck at the neighbor's house below and ran in to call 911. That had ended the argument between Sandy Jones and Wilfred Gerttula. </p><p> It's true I'd often said that a trial lawyer without a good murder case isn't a real trial lawyer. Those who represent large corporations and like to stay sprayed in the perfumed mist of corporate dollars, who won't get down in the pits and get bloodied in the wars where human beings are at stake, are not real trial lawyers. If a trial lawyer won't take on a murder case because he doesn't want to get his hands dirty or because there isn't any money in it, the system fails. It not only fails the accused, it fails the rest of us. Someday when some fair-haired prosecutor with the governor's chair glowing in his mind's eye decides to charge one of us or one of our kids with a crime -- well, that hated, scorned, and damned of the legal profession, the trial lawyer, better be around to see that we get a fair trial, and that if we're innocent, we walk out the courtroom free. </p><p> One day in November 1985, I got a letter from a woman named Carol Van Strum. She and her husband were waging their own lonesome battle with the Forest Service. She wrote me that a citizen in Lincoln County, Oregon, had been charged with murder and that the woman's husband, a man named Mike Jones, whom she'd never met, had driven two hours in the cold of night to ask her for help. He had a small girl with him, his daughter, Shawn, about ten. The child was sick with the flu, and the woman put the child to bed while she talked with him. Why Jones had sought her help she didn't know. But from what he told her she thought something was fishy. The cops were holding the man's wife in isolation. The cops had their excuses. Van Strum wrote: </p><p><br> The only person allowed to visit her other than her attorney was her Native American Church minister. Approximately a month before, the minister himself was arrested for blocking the road on the Jones property, booked and released. The police claimed he was infected with hepatitis A. After that even he was barred from visiting Sandy and she's been kept in isolation for four months on the excuse that she's been exposed to the disease. She's received neither medical attention nor blood tests to establish the presence of the hepatitis antibodies. None of the jail staff or police officers involved in the minister's arrest have been similarly quarantined. </p><p><br> When Mike Jones asked the Van Strum woman for help, the only help she could think of was to write to me. </p><p> "That's a bunch of bullshit," I said to Eddie Moriarity, my partner of many years. I slammed the letter down. "If you put everybody in isolation who's been exposed to hepatitis, the whole world would have to be cooped up." </p><p> After a couple of calls, Eddie reported back. "It's true: the Jones woman's been in jail since July. Four months! The chief judge assigned a guy named Gardner to hear the case. Gardner won't let her even touch her kids." </p><p> "They're twisting her for a guilty plea," I said. I'd been defending murder cases for more than three decades, and if I'd learned one thing it was that trials do not seek the truth, nor are they always intended to deliver justice. Trials are wars -- wars that are won more than 90 percent of the time by the state. </p><p> "There's not one murder case here, there's two," Eddie said. "The Joneses' fifteen-year-old boy is charged with murder in the juvenile court. The kid was up there when Gerttula was shot. Shawn, the little girl, is cryin' for her mom. Her mom can't make bail. No collateral. Even their chicken house is mortgaged." </p><p> I see it in nearly every case. Innocent or not, hold them long enough in some miserable jail, frighten them enough, make them desperate enough, and the state wouldn't have to prove its case. And you have to remember: some charged with murder are innocent. They're usually poor and usually helpless to do much in defense of themselves. Under our Constitution, every person charged with a crime is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In truth, most people charged with a crime are <i>presumed guilty</i> even by the jurors who hear their cases. </p><p> "How come they charged the kid in juvenile court?" I asked. "Most prosecutors would have charged him as an adult. These must be good guys." </p><p> "Oregon law required 'em to file the case in juvenile court," Eddie said. "But the legislature passed a new juvenile law that became effective on October 10. Ulys Stapleton, the DA, threatened Michele Longo -- she's Sandy Jones's court-appointed lawyer -- that if the kid didn't turn himself in fast, Stapleton would charge him as an adult. Boy came in on his own a few days after the shooting. But before he came in, Stapleton threatened Longo he was going to send out a tactical team to take the kid out. Jesus! Threatening a tactical team to take out a fifteen-year-old!" He shook his head; the Irish smile vanished. "They have the smokin' gun and the eyewitness," Moriarity said. "Easy case to prove. Take about ten minutes. Why those tactics?" </p><p> "Maybe there's something wrong with the state's case, or maybe they're just used to those brownshirt tactics up there." </p><p> "Maybe," Eddie said. </p><p> "Maybe we'd better go see what's going on in Lincoln County," I said. </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by G.

In this new book, she skillfully weaves together ecology, ethnobotany, horticulture, spirituality, science, and alternative medicine to capture the magic spell that trees cast over us, from their untapped ecological and pharmaceutical potential to the roles they have played in our cultural heritage. Trees not only breathe and communicate; they also reproduce, provide shelter, medicine, and food, and connect disparate elements of the natural world. In celebrating forests' function and beauty, Beresford-Kroeger warns what a deforested world would look like.

You require only one quality when you begin. That is seriously to want to learn to mediate."The central message of the New Testament is that there is really only one prayer and that this prayer is the prayer of Christ. It is a prayer that continues in our heart day and night. John Main describes this prayer as the stream of love that flows constantly between Jesus and his Father. This stream of love is the Holy SpiritIt is John Main's conviction that is it the most important task for any fully human life that we should become as open as possible to this stream of love. In order for us to do this we must learn a way that is a way of silence - of stillness - and this by a discipline that is most demanding.John Main talks about the many aspects of silent prayer: the way of the mantra, leaving distraction behind, fullness of life in love and silence. A striking feature of the book is its emphasis on simplicity, on transcending self-consciousness and moving beyond "techniques" of prayer.</p></p><p>John Main (1926-1982) was a Benedictine mond whom Bede Griffiths once acclaimed &#34;the best spiritual guide in the church today.&#34; His work continues to guide many to deeper spirituality and also to inspire inter-religious dialogue.</p><h2>Oh!

Although her father explains that these attacks are in retaliation for promises broken by the settlers and the English government, she is still frightened. While on their way to school several weeks later, Caty and her brother are captured by a group of Lenape. Although she fears that they will both be murdered, they are not harmed and are given to two members of the tribe who had lost children to measles, a disease brought by white traders. Through her friendship with Snow Hunter, a young man who had been captured nine years earlier, Caty gains an understanding of these people and their beliefs. She also begins to fall in love with him. Eventually, English soldiers rescue the girl and her brother. Caty's return to Quaker life is very difficult; she feels estranged from her mother and her old friends and yearns for Snow Hunter and her Indian family. Osborne successfully sustains readers' attention with a strong story line while informing them about American history. Through Caty's experiences, they will gain a clearer understanding of the Quaker religion and the beliefs of the Lenape. Complete with background information and illustrations depicting life during this era, this is a solid piece of historical fiction.<br><i>Ann M. Burlingame, North Regional Library, Raleigh, NC</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 3^-6. This offering in the Dear America series (see also White's <i>Voyage on the Great Titanic</i>, reviewed below) introduces Catharine Carey Logan, a 13-year-old Quaker girl living in rural Pennsylvania in 1763. When Caty and her younger brother, Thomas, are captured by a band of Lenape warriors, she fears the worst. For months she rails against her captors at every opportunity, despite their humane treatment of her. Then, her blossoming friendship with Snow Hunter, an English captive who has decided to remain with the tribe permanently, helps her see the good in this very different culture. Although she is eventually recaptured by the English, her newfound empathy for the Lenape lifestyle leaves her an alien in her own world. Osborne's strength is her portrayal of Caty's gradual realization that the Lenape are not savages but human beings with views as legitimate as her own. Appended with a historical note, period artwork, maps, and drawings, this will be popular with history buffs and classes studying Pennsylvania history. <i>Kay Weisman</i></p><h2>The Book of New Family Traditions: How to Create Great Rituals for Holidays and Every Day</h2><p>Families will treasure this collection of rituals and traditions for many occasions, from such personal milestones as a child&#39;s first day of school or a teenager&#39;s new driver&#39;s license to mainstream holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries.

As he entered the small caf�, he had no way of knowing how valuable the next few hours would be. </p><p> When he saw Ann Carr, he was surprised. He had heard she had been through some tough times herself and expected it to show on her. But she seemed upbeat and full of energy. </p><p> After some preliminary conversation, he said, "You look like you're in a good place, despite the bad times I understand you've been through." </p><p> She said, "I <i>am</i> in a good place, both in my work and in my life. But it's not in <i>spite</i> of the bad times. It's <i>because</i> of them -- and how I learned to take advantage of them." </p><p> Michael was puzzled. "How so?" he asked. </p><p> "Well, for example, at work I thought our department was doing fine, but in reality we weren't. We'd been successful, but we'd become complacent. By the time we realized it, other companies were doing much better than we were. My boss became very unhappy with me. </p><p> "That's when I started feeling low, and the pressure to improve things in a hurry began. Each day became more stressful." </p><p> Michael asked, "So, what happened?" </p><p> She answered, "I heard a story last year from someone at work I respected. It changed how I looked at good and bad times, and what I do now is very different. The story helped me to be calmer and more successful, whether things are going well or not, even in my personal life. I'll never forget it!" </p><p> "What was the story?" he asked. </p><p> Ann was quiet for a moment, and then said, "Would it be all right if I asked why you would like to know about it?" </p><p> Michael reluctantly admitted that he was not feeling very secure in his job, and things were not going so well for him at home. </p><p> He didn't need to say any more. She felt his embarrassment, and said, "You sound like you need to hear the story as much as I did." </p><p> Ann said she would tell Michael the story with the understanding that if he found it valuable, he would share it with others. He agreed, and Ann prepared Michael for what he was about to hear. </p><p> She said, "I found that if you want to use the story to deal with the ups and downs that come at you, it helps if you listen with your heart and head, and fill in the story with your own experience to see what is true for <i>you</i>. </p><p> "The insights in the story are often repeated, although in slightly different ways." </p><p> Michael asked "Why the repetition?" </p><p> She answered, "Well, for me, it made it easier to remember them. And when I remembered the insights, I used them more." </p><p> She admitted, "I'm reluctant to change. So, I need to hear something new often enough that, at some point, it gets past my critical, distrusting mind, becomes more familiar, and touches my heart. Then it becomes a part of me. </p><p> "That's what happened after I thought a lot about the story. But you can discover that for yourself, if you like." </p><p> "Do you really think a story can make that big a difference?" Michael asked. "I'm in a pretty tough spot right now." </p><p> Ann replied, "In that case, what do you have to lose? All I can tell you is that when I applied what I got out of the story, it had a big impact. </p><p> "Some people," she cautioned, "get very little from the story, while others get a great deal! </p><p> "It's not the story; it's what you take away from it that is so powerful. That's up to you, of course." </p><p> Michael nodded. "Okay. I think I would really like to hear it." </p><p> So Ann started to tell the tale over dinner, and then continued through dessert and coffee. </p><p> She began: Copyright � 2009 by Spencer Johnson, M.D.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b> 1<br> Feeling Low In A Valley </b> </p><p> Once there was a bright young man who lived unhappily in a valley, until he went to see an old man who lived on a peak. When he was younger, he had been happy in his valley. He played in its meadows and swam in its river. </p><p> The valley was all he had ever known, and he thought he would spend his whole life there. </p><p> Some days in his valley were cloudy and some were sunny, but there was a sameness to his daily routine that he found comforting. </p><p> However, as he grew older, he began to see what was wrong more often than he noticed what was right. He wondered why he had not noticed before how many things were wrong in the valley. </p><p> As time went on, the young man became increasingly unhappy, although he wasn't sure why. </p><p> He tried working at different jobs in the valley, but none turned out to be what he had hoped for. </p><p> In one job, his boss always seemed to criticize him for what he did wrong and never noticed all the things he did right. </p><p> In another, he was one of so many employees that it didn't seem to matter to anyone whether he worked hard or hardly worked at all. His contribution seemed invisible, even to himself. </p><p> Once, he thought he had finally found what he wanted. He felt appreciated and challenged, he worked with capable colleagues, and he was proud of the company's product. He worked his way up and became manager of a small department. </p><p> Unfortunately, he felt his job was not secure. </p><p> His personal life was no better. One disappointment seemed to follow another. </p><p> He thought his friends didn't understand, and his family told him he was "just going through a phase." </p><p> The young man wondered if he would be better off someplace else. </p><p> Sometimes the young man would stand in the meadow and look up at the range of majestic peaks that rose high above his valley. </p><p> He would imagine himself standing on the nearby peak. </p><p> For a while, he felt better. </p><p> But the more he compared the peak to his valley, the worse he felt. </p><p> He spoke to his parents and friends about going to the peak. But they talked only about how difficult it was to reach the peak, and how comfortable it was to stay in the valley. </p><p> They all discouraged him from going where they themselves had never been. </p><p> The young man loved his parents and knew there was some truth to what they said. But he also knew that he was a different person from his father and mother. </p><p> Sometimes he felt there might be a different way of life outside the valley, and he wanted to discover it for himself. Maybe on the peak he could gain a better view of the world. </p><p> But then doubt and fear crept in again, and he thought he would stay where he was. </p><p> For a long time the young man could not bring himself to leave his valley. </p><p> Then one day, he recalled his early youth and realized how much had changed since then. He was no longer at peace with himself. </p><p> He wasn't sure why he changed his mind, but he suddenly decided he had to go visit that mountaintop. </p><p> He put his fear aside and got ready to leave as quickly as he could. Then, he set out for the nearby peak. </p><p> It was not an easy journey. It took him much longer than he thought it would to make it less than halfway up the peak. </p><p> But as the young man went higher, the cool breeze and fresh air revitalized him. From higher up, his valley looked smaller. </p><p> When he had been down in the valley, the air seemed clean enough. But when he viewed the valley from above, he saw the pale brown stagnant air that was trapped there. </p><p> Then he turned and continued upward. The higher he climbed, the more he could see. </p><p> Suddenly, the trail he was following ended. </p><p> With no trail to follow, he became lost among the thick trees that blocked out the light. He feared he would not find his way out. </p><p> So, he decided to cross a dangerously narrow ridge. As he did, he fell. Bruised and bleeding, he picked himself up and continued on. </p><p> Eventually, he found a new path. </p><p> The warnings of the people in the valley crossed his mind. But then he gathered his courage and kept climbing. </p><p> The higher he went, the happier he became, knowing that he was leaving the valley and putting aside his fears. </p><p> He was on his way to someplace new. </p><p> As he rose above the clouds, he realized it was a beautiful day and imagined how the sunset would look from the summit. He could hardly wait to see it from up there.

All the residents of Sheridan Square have a key to the garden - but no-one seemed to know that Mirabelle was planning to arrive. So the question facing Mrs. Jeffries is: who wanted to make sure that Mirabelle's visit was very, very short-lived?<br></p><p>Having married an Englishman in 1976, Cheryl Arguile lived near London for a while before moving back to California, where she had been brought up. She then decided to embark on a writing career first as a romantic novelist (Sarah Temple) and later writing for young adults (Cheryl Lanham) but is best known as Emily Brightwell for the Mrs Jeffries series.<b>MRS. JEFFRIES</b> <p> <b>ROCKS THE BOAT</b></p> <b>CHAPTER 1</b> <p> Malcolm Tavistock unlocked the heavy, spiked gate and pushed it open. Come along, Hector,&#x201d; he said, yanking gently on the bulldog&#x2019;s lead. Hector, with one last sniff at an errant dandelion that had poked up between the stone squares of the footpath, followed his master.</p> <p> Humph,&#x201d; Tavistock glared at the dandelion as he and the dog stepped into the gated garden in the middle of Sheridan Square. He made a mental note to have a word with the gardener. The place certainly looked scruffy. He pulled the gate shut behind him and made sure he heard the lock engage before carefully pocketing the key.</p> <p> Sheridan Square was for residents only. It wasn&#x2019;t a public garden and Malcolm, for his part, would do his best to insure it never became one. It rather annoyed him that some of his other neighbors on the square weren&#x2019;t as diligent as he was about insuring the security of the garden. Tugging at the dog&#x2019;s lead, Tavistock strolled up the footpath toward the center of the large square, his eagle eye on the lookout for more signs of neglect on the part of the gardener. The animal trudged along next to his master, keeping his nose close to the ground and sniffing happily at the bits of grass and clumps of leaves.</p> <p> Suddenly, Hector came to a dead stop and his thick white head shot up. He sniffed the air and then lunged up the path, yanking his master along behind him.</p> <p> Hold on, old fellow,&#x201d; Malcolm ordered as he pulled back on the lead. He wasn&#x2019;t through ascertaining exactly how much of a tongue-lashing to give that wretched gardener. Humph,&#x201d; he sniffed as he surveyed the area. The place was abysmal. The bushes along the perimeter had grown high and unwieldy. The footpath was scattered with stems and leaves and bits of dried grass, the flower beds were filled with weeds, and the lilac bushes were completely overgrown. Well, really,&#x201d; Malcolm muttered. Am I the only one that cares how this garden looks? The garden committee shall certainly hear about this.&#x201d;</p> <p> Hector lunged again, almost yanking Malcolm off his feet.</p> <p> Oh, all right.&#x201d; Malcolm finally decided to let the poor dog have his walkies. He looked around, saw that he was the only one in the garden, and then dropped the lead. Go on, boy. I&#x2019;ll catch up in a moment.&#x201d; Hector took off like a shot. Malcolm reached down and picked up a dirty bit of paper that was littering the path. Honestly,&#x201d; he muttered as he crumpled the paper into a tight ball, some people have no consideration for others.&#x201d;</p> <p> From the center of the square, Hector howled.</p> <p> Malcom was so startled, he jumped. He stuffed the paper in his pocket and ran towards his dog. His heart pounded against his chest. For all his grumbling, he loved that silly dog, and Hector might look like a terror, but he was easily upset.</p> <p> Flying up the path, Malcolm skidded to a halt. Hector was perfectly all right. He was standing next to a bench upon which a woman lay stretched out sound asleep.</p> <p> Well, really,&#x201d; he exclaimed. What has become of this neighborhood! Hector, come away from that disreputable person immediately.&#x201d; This wasn&#x2019;t the first time such a thing had happened. Because the garden was shielded by the high foliage from the eyes of passing policemen, vagrants occasionally climbed the fence. But this was the first time Malcolm had ever seen a woman do it. What is the world coming to?&#x201d; Malcolm muttered. He marched toward the bench. I blame those silly suffragettes,&#x201d; he told Hector. Puts stupid ideas in women&#x2019;s heads.&#x201d; He bent over the sleeping woman, frowning as he realized her clothes were new and expensive. Not the sort of clothes a vagrant would wear. He was suddenly a bit cautious. Uh, miss.&#x201d; He poked her gently in the arm. Is everything all right?&#x201d;</p> <p> The woman lay silent.</p> <p> Hector whined softly.</p> <p> Frightened now, Malcolm looked around him at his surroundings and wished he were visible from the street. The hair on the back of his neck stood up, and he shivered. But he couldn&#x2019;t just leave the woman lying here. Miss,&#x201d; he said loudly, are you all right?&#x201d;</p> <p> Hector whined again and stuck his nose under the wooden slats. But his head wouldn&#x2019;t go in very far as the lead had got tangled around the base of the gas lamp next to the bench. Malcolm bent down and untangled the lead; as he stood up, he saw what was under the bench. Stunned, he blinked and then forced himself to look again. But the view didn&#x2019;t change. In the pale morning light it was easy to see exactly what it was. Blood. Lots of it. Grabbing the dog&#x2019;s lead, he pulled him hard toward the gate. Come on, Hector, we&#x2019;ve got to find a policeman. That poor woman&#x2019;s dead. There&#x2019;s blood everywhere.&#x201d;</p> <p> Hepzibah Jeffries, housekeeper to Inspector Gerald Witherspoon of Scotland Yard, stepped into the kitchen and surveyed her kingdom with amusement. Wiggins, the apple-cheeked young footman, sat at the kitchen table. Beside him sat a scruffy young street arab named Jeremy Blevins. In front of them was an open book, a pencil and a large sheet of paper. At the far end of the long table, Betsy, the blond-haired maid, sat polishing silver. Mrs. Goodge, the gray-haired, portly cook stood at the kitchen sink scrubbing vegetables for the evening stew.</p> <p> The only one missing was Smythe, the coachman. But as it was almost morning teatime, Mrs. Jeffries expected him in any minute.</p> <p> Shall I make the tea?&#x201d; Mrs. Jeffries asked the cook as she came on into the kitchen.</p> <p> No need.&#x201d; Mrs. Goodge jerked her chin to her left, toward a linen-covered tray that rested on the counter. It&#x2019;s all done. But if you could just put the kettle on to boil, I&#x2019;d be obliged. My hands are wet.&#x201d;</p> <p> Certainly.&#x201d; The housekeeper did as she was asked.</p> <p> Come on now, Jeremy,&#x201d; Wiggins said to the lad, Concentrate. You know what that letter is. You learned it yesterday.&#x201d;</p> <p> I am concentratin&#x2019;,&#x201d; the boy shot back. But it&#x2019;s bloomin&#x2019; hard to remember every little thing.&#x201d; His thin face scrunched as he stared at the book. Uh, it&#x2019;s a C,&#x2019; right?&#x201d;</p> <p> It&#x2019;s a G,&#x2019;&#x201d; Wiggins corrected. Can&#x2019;t you remember?&#x201d;</p> <p> Leave off, Wiggins,&#x201d; Betsy interjected. Jeremy&#x2019;s doing well. He&#x2019;s learned ever so much in just a few days.&#x201d;</p> <p> Ta, miss.&#x201d; Jeremy beamed at Betsy. I reckon I&#x2019;ve done well too mind you, I don&#x2019;t know why I&#x2019;m botherin&#x2019; with book learnin&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s not like the likes of me&#x2019;ll ever get a chance to use it much.&#x201d;</p> <p> You don&#x2019;t want to be ignorant all yer life, do ya?&#x201d; Wiggins cuffed the lad gently on the arm and closed the book. Besides, you never know what the future holds. At least if you know your letters and can read a bit, you&#x2019;ll be able to sign your own name.&#x201d;</p> <p> Fat lot of good that&#x2019;ll do me,&#x201d; Jeremy grumbled. He&#x2019;d only told this lot he wanted to learn to read as a means of getting into the house and having a bite of food every now and again. He&#x2019;d not expected they&#x2019;d take him at his word and whip out this silly book every time he came around because his belly was touching his backbone. Still, Jeremy mused, they were a decent lot. Treated him well, even if they did expect him to learn his bleedin&#x2019; letters. He glanced at the covered tray and wondered what sort of goodies were under the linen. He&#x2019;d already been fed, but it never hurt to get some extra. When you lived like he did, you never knew when you might next eat. Are ya havin&#x2019; a fancy tea, then?&#x201d;</p> <p> No,&#x201d; Betsy replied. She tossed her polishing cloth to one side and stood up. Just our usual. Why? Are you still hungry?&#x201d; Having been raised in one of the poorest slums of London, she was well aware of what the lad was up to. She&#x2019;d lived on the streets for a time herself and knew what it was like to try and survive. Help yourself to some more buns if you&#x2019;re still feeling peckish. There&#x2019;s plenty in the larder.&#x201d; She lifted the heavy tray of silver and started for the pantry.</p> <p> Surprised, Jeremy gaped at her and then quickly scrambled to his feet. He didn&#x2019;t bother to look at the others; he simply followed Betsy down the hallway. He&#x2019;d known as soon as he asked the question that he should have kept his mouth shut. When people were doling out charity, they didn&#x2019;t like you to be greedy. He couldn&#x2019;t believe she wasn&#x2019;t cuffing him on the ears or giving him a lecture.</p> <p> The buns are in the dry larder,&#x201d; Betsy called over her shoulder. She indicated a closed door she&#x2019;d just passed and grinned as she heard it creak open behind her.</p> <p> Thanks, miss,&#x201d; Jeremy called as he darted inside the larder. I&#x2019;ll &#x2019;elp meself if ya don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p> <p> At the far end of the hall, the back door opened and a tall, dark-haired fellow with heavy features stepped inside. He took one look at the maid and frowned ominously it was a scowl that could send strong men running for cover, but it had no effect whatsoever on Betsy. You oughtn&#x2019;t to be liftin&#x2019; that &#x2019;eavy tray.&#x201d; He came forward and took it out of her hands.</p> <p> Don&#x2019;t be silly, Smythe,&#x201d; she replied. It&#x2019;s not at all heavy. It&#x2019;s only a bit of silver.&#x201d;</p> <p> Smythe, the coachman, had been courting Betsy for some time now. Though they seemed quite mismatched, they were, in fact, very devoted to one another. He glanced up the hall to make sure the coast was clear and then leaned forward and snatched a quick kiss.</p> <p> Jeremy chose that moment to pop out of the pantry. I only took &#x201d; His voice trailed off as the two adults sprang apart.</p> <p> Betsy whirled about, her face crimson at having been caught, even by a street lad. Did you get some buns, then?&#x201d;</p> <p> Jeremy, who was almost as embarrassed as the maid, held up two of them. He&#x2019;d been tempted to take more but decided against it. I took these for me sister,&#x201d; he explained honestly. She&#x2019;s only four. I&#x2019;d best be off then,&#x201d; he mumbled as he pushed past the couple and headed for the back door, Tell Wiggins I&#x2019;ll be back in a couple of days,&#x201d; he said as he scurried out and slammed the door behind him.</p> <p> I do think we embarrassed the boy.&#x201d; Smythe&#x2019;s voice was amused.</p> <p> You shouldn&#x2019;t have kissed me,&#x201d; Betsy hissed. He&#x2019;ll tell Wiggins, you know.&#x201d;</p> <p> Smythe only grinned. The entire household knew that he and Betsy were sweethearts. Knew and approved. But unfortunately, their courtship kept getting interrupted by the inspector&#x2019;s murder cases. Help me take this to the pantry,&#x201d; he said softly.</p> <p> You don&#x2019;t need any help,&#x201d; Betsy protested. She looked quickly back toward the kitchen. The others will wonder what we&#x2019;re up to.&#x201d;</p> <p> The others will understand we&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; a bit of courtin&#x2019;,&#x201d; he insisted. He started for a closed doorway opposite the wet larder.</p> <p> All right.&#x201d; Betsy followed him. What have you been doing this morning?&#x201d;</p> <p> He opened the pantry door and stepped inside. After I dropped the inspector off, I took Bow and Arrow for a good run,&#x201d; he replied. They needed the exercise. Where do ya want this?&#x201d;</p> <p> Put it over there.&#x201d; Betsy pointed to an empty shelf on the opposite wall. The tiny butler&#x2019;s pantry was too small for furniture. It consisted mainly of shelves of various sizes running up and down the length of the walls. Smythe carefully eased the tray into its place and then turned and pulled her close in a bear hug. Betsy giggled.</p> <p> In the kitchen, Wiggins glanced toward the hallway. I thought I &#x2019;eard Smythe come in.&#x201d; He started to get up. And where&#x2019;s that lad got to?&#x201d;</p> <p> Sit down, Wiggins,&#x201d; Mrs. Jeffries ordered. Smythe has come in, and I think he&#x2019;s probably helping Betsy put the silver away. I expect that Jeremy has helped himself to some buns and left.&#x201d; Unlike the footman, she knew precisely what was going on down the hallway.</p> <p> But I need to &#x2019;ave a word with Smythe.&#x201d; Wiggins started to get up again. &#x2019;E promised to &#x201d;</p> <p> Sit down, boy,&#x201d; Mrs. Goodge said sharply. You&#x2019;ve no need to go botherin&#x2019; Smythe now. He&#x2019;ll be in for his tea in a few minutes. You can talk to him then.&#x201d;</p> <p> But Betsy&#x2019;s talkin&#x2019; to &#x2019;im now &#x201d; Wiggins&#x2019;s voice trailed off as he realized what the two women already knew. His broad face creased in a sheepish grin. Oh, I see what ya mean. They&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; a bit of courtin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p> <p> That&#x2019;s none of our business.&#x201d; Mrs. Goodge placed the tray of food in the center of the table. She pushed a plate of sticky buns as far away from Wiggins as possible and shoved a plate of sliced brown bread and butter in front of the boy. He ate far too many sweets. Then she put the creamer and sugar bowl next to the stack of mugs already on the table. Lastly, she put the heavy, brown teapot in front of the housekeeper and then shoved the empty tray onto the counter behind her.</p> <p> Mrs. Jeffries smiled her thanks and began pouring out the tea. She&#x2019;d done a lot of thinking about Betsy and Smythe. They were, of course, perfect for one another. She certainly hoped that Smythe would ask the girl to marry him. She wasn&#x2019;t foolish enough to think a change of that significance wouldn&#x2019;t have an effect on the household. It would. A profound effect.</p> <p> To begin with, she wondered if the two of them would want to stay on in the household if they married. Normally, a maid and a coachman who wed would simply move into their own room and stay on. But these weren&#x2019;t normal circumstances. Smythe would want to give his bride her own home. A home she suspected he could well afford. The housekeeper was fairly certain that one of the main reasons he&#x2019;d not yet proposed was because he couldn&#x2019;t think of a way to tell the lass the truth about himself. But that wasn&#x2019;t what was worrying the housekeeper. Smythe could deal with that in his own good time. What concerned her was what would happen to their investigations if Smythe and Betsy married and moved out.</p> <p> She sighed inwardly. There was nothing constant but change in life, she thought. When she&#x2019;d come here a few years back, she&#x2019;d never thought she and the others would get so involved in investigating murders. But they had. They&#x2019;d done a rather good job of it as well, she thought proudly. Not that their dear inspector suspected they were the reason behind his success as Scotland Yard&#x2019;s most brilliant detective. Oh dear, no, that would never do.</p> <p> Mrs. Jeffries put the heavy pot down. They&#x2019;d come together and formed a formidable team. The household, along with their friends Luty Belle Crookshank and her butler Hatchet had investigated one heinous crime after another. Those investigations had brought a group of lonely people closer to one another. In their own way, they&#x2019;d become a family. Now they had to make some adjustments. Murder, as interesting as it was, couldn&#x2019;t compete with true love. Especially, she told herself, when they didn&#x2019;t even have one to investigate. Not that she was thinking that someone ought to die just so she and the rest of the staff could indulge themselves. Goodness, no, that would never do. Murder was a terrible, terrible crime. It was impossible to think otherwise.</p> <p> Still, if someone did die, she thought wistfully, it would break the monotony of the household routine and give all of them a much-needed bit of excitement. She shook herself when she realized where her thoughts were taking her. Then she looked up and found the cook gazing at her with an amused expression on her face.

Theseresourceful children squabble, make up, and have many memorable adventures, from publishing their own newspaper to foiling a pair of real bandits and even becoming kidnappers themselves. But while the efforts of the Bastables are often ingenious, their good intentions always go hilariously awry. This lively, funny story perfectly captures these children&#39;s remarkable bravery and deep sense of honor. First published in 1899, this children&#39;s classic is available again for a new generation of readers with a magnificent cover illustration by Caldecott winner Paul O. Zelinsky.</p><p>E. Nesbit (1858-1924) lived in England and had dreamed of becoming a poet since she was fifteen years old. After her husband fell ill, it was up to her to support her small family. For the next nineteen years, she published a number of novels, essays, articles, poems, and short stories. When The Story of the Treasure Seekers was published in 1899, her groundbreaking style of depicting realistic, believable children quickly gained a popularity that has lasted for more than a century.The six Bastable children try to restore their family&#39;s fortune using a variety of schemes taken from books, including finding buried treasure, rescuing someone from bandits, and starting a newspaper.</p><h2>Phallos: Enhanced and Revised Edition</h2><p>Phallos is a 2004 novel by the acclaimed novelist and critic Samuel R. Delany. Taking the form of a gay pornographic novella, with the explicit sex omitted, Phallos is set during the reign of the second-century Roman emperor Hadrian, and circles around the historical account of the murder of the emperor&#39;s favorite, Antinous. The story moves from Syracuse to Egypt, from the Pillars of Hercules to Rome, from Athens to Byzantium, and back. Young Neoptolomus searches after the stolen phallus of the nameless god of Hermopolis, crafted of gold and encrusted with jewels, within which are reputedly the ancient secrets of science and society that will lead to power, knowledge, and wealth. Vivid and clever, the original novella has been expanded by nearly a third. Appended to the text are an afterword by Robert F. Reid-Pharr and three astute speculative essays by Steven Shaviro, Kenneth R. James, and Darieck Scott.</p><p>SAMUEL R. DELANY teaches English and creative writing at Temple University and is the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, most recently his novel Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders.

Quality assurance was conducted on each of these books in an attempt to remove books with imperfections introduced by the digitization process. Though we have made best efforts - the books may have occasional errors that do not impede the reading experience. We believe this work is culturally important and have elected to bring the book back into print as part of our continuing commitment to the preservation of printed works worldwide.</p><p><i>The Science of the Mind</i> was originally published in 1926 by the founder of the worldwide Religious Science movement. It was completely revised in 1938 by Ernest Holmes and Maude Allison Latham; this 1997 edition is the 1938 version with an added introduction by Jean Houston and a one-year study program that breaks the weighty tome into digestible bits. Using creative techniques, Holmes guides the student in easy-to-follow steps toward mastering the powers of the mind to find purpose in life. His explanations of how to pray and meditate, heal oneself spiritually, find self confidence, and express love have helped millions change their lives for the better. <i>The Science of Mind</i> is one of those spiritual classics that belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who wishes a life for themselves free of compulsion and negativity. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>The Science of Mind, among the most respected spiritual books of our century, contains the fundamentals of Holmes&#39;s teachings and is a primary resource used by teaching centers and spiritual healers worldwide. The universal principles in this powerful book apply to people of all spiritual backgrounds as they describe the road to freedom attainable through the intelligent use of Nature&#39;s forces and laws to allow God - the creative power of love, freedom, and humanity - to work through them. Holmes seems to have anticipated the future in creativity and personal growth, and his book&#39;s goal is to suggest how you may pilot your entire life. Detailing the amazing, subtle powers of the mind, and how you can use them, it explains many of the basic truths known to the enlightened of all ages, and distills them to primary elements, easily understood.</p><h2>Usborne Geography Encyclopedia with Complete World Atlas IL</h2><p>This newly updated book will introduce you to the whole field of geography, from rocks and their formation, the Solar System, weather and climates, and oceans, to human settlements, population trends, diverse ecosystems and environmental concerns.</p><p></p><h2>Deep Storm</h2><p>In this explosive new thriller, one of the most incredible and frightening discoveries mankind has ever faced is about to surface.On an oil platform in the middle of the North Atlantic, a terrifying series of illnesses is spreading through the crew. When expert naval doctor Peter Crane is flown in, he finds his real destination is not the platform itself but Deep Storm: a top secret aquatic science facility, two miles below on the ocean floor. And as Crane soon learns, the covert operation he finds there is concealing something far more sinister than a medical mystery-and much more deadly.</p><p><b>Lincoln Child</b> is the author of <i>Death Match</i> and the bestselling <i>Utopia</i>, as well as co-author, with Douglas Preston, of numerous <i>New York Times </i>Bestsellers (including <i>The Book of the Dead</i>, <i>Dance of Death</i>, <i>The Cabinet of Curiosities</i>, <i>Still Life With Crows, </i>and <i>Relic)</i>. He lives with his wife and daughter in Morristown, New Jersey.<b>1</b><br>It looked, Peter Crane thought, like a stork: a huge white stork, rising out of the water on ridiculously delicate legs. But as the helicopter drew closer and the distant outline sharpened against the sea horizon, the resemblance gradually fell away. The legs grew sturdier, became tubular pylons of steel and pre&#x2013;stressed concrete. The central body became a multi&#x2013;level superstructure, studded with flare stacks and turbines, festooned with spars and girders. And the thin, neck&#x2013;like object above resolved into a complex crane-and-derrick assembly, rising several hundred feet above the superstructure.<br><br>The pilot pointed at the approaching platform, held up two fingers. Crane nodded his understanding.<br><br>It was a brilliant, cloudless day, and Crane squinted against the bright ocean stretching away on all sides. He felt tired and disoriented by travel: commercial flight from Miami to New York, private Gulfstream G150 charter to Reykjavik, and now helicopter. But the weariness hadn&#x2019;t blunted his deep&#x2014;and growing&#x2014;curiosity.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t so much that Amalgamated Shale was interested in his particular expertise: that he thought he could understand. It was the hurry with which they&#x2019;d wanted him to drop everything and rush out to the Storm King platform that surprised him. Then there was the fact that AmShale&#x2019;s forward headquarters in Iceland had, rather oddly, been bustling with technicians and engineers rather than the usual drillers and roughnecks.<br><br>And then there was the other thing. The helicopter pilot wasn&#x2019;t an AmShale employee. He wore a Navy uniform&#x2014;and a sidearm.<br><br>As the chopper banked sharply around the side of the platform, heading for the landing zone, Crane realized for the first time just how large the oil rig was. The jacket structure alone had to be eight stories high. Its upper deck was covered with a bewildering maze of modular structures. Here and there, men in yellow safety uniforms checked couplings and worked pump equipment, dwarfed by the machinery that surrounded them. Far, far below, the ocean frothed and worried around the pillars of the substructure, where it vanished beneath the surface to run the thousands of feet to the sea floor itself.<br><br>The chopper slowed, turned, and settled down onto the green hexagon of the landing zone. As Crane reached back for his bags, he noticed that someone was standing at the edge of the LZ, waiting: a tall, thin woman in an oilskin jacket. He thanked the pilot, opened the passenger door, and stepped out into frigid air, ducking instinctively under the whirring blades.<br><br>The woman held out her hand at his approach. &#x201c;Dr. Crane?&#x201d;<br><br>Crane shook the hand. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This way, please.&#x201d; The woman turned and led the way off the landing platform, down a short set of stairs, and along a metal catwalk to a closed, submarine&#x2013;style hatch. She did not give her name.<br><br>A uniformed seaman stood guard outside the hatch, rifle at his side. He nodded as they approached, opened the hatch, then closed and secured it behind them.<br><br>Beyond lay a spacious, brightly&#x2013;lit corridor, studded along both sides with open doors. There was no frantic hum of turbines, no deep throbbing of derrick equipment. The smell of oil, though detectable, was faint, almost as if efforts had been made to remove it.<br><br>Crane followed the woman, bags slung over his shoulder, glancing curiously into the rooms as he passed. Once again, curiosity pricked at him: there were laboratories full of whiteboards and workstations; computer centers; communications suites. Topside had been quiet, but there was plenty of activity here.<br><br>Crane decided he&#x2019;d venture a question. &#x201c;Are the divers in a hyperbaric chamber?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Can I see them now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This way, please,&#x201d; the woman repeated.<br><br>They turned a corner, descended a staircase, and entered another hallway, even wider and longer than the first. The rooms they passed were larger here: machine shops, storage bays for high&#x2013;tech equipment Crane didn&#x2019;t recognize. Crane frowned. Although Storm King resembled an oil rig in all outward appearances, it was clearly no longer in the business of pumping crude.<br><br><i>What the hell is going on here?</i><br><br>&#x201c;Have any vascular specialists or pulmonologists been flown in from Iceland?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>The woman didn&#x2019;t answer, and Crane shrugged. He&#x2019;d come this far&#x2014;he could stand to wait another couple of minutes.<br><br>Up ahead, the woman had stopped before a closed door of gray metal. &#x201c;Mr. Lassiter is waiting for you,&#x201d; she said.<br><br><i>Lassiter</i>? Crane wondered. That wasn&#x2019;t a name he recognized. The person who&#x2019;d spoken to him over the phone, briefed him about the problem at the rig, had been named Simon. He glanced at the door. There was the nameplate, white letters on black plastic, spelling out <i>E. Lassiter, External Liaison</i>.<br><br>Crane turned back to the woman in the oilskin jacket, but she was already moving down the corridor. He shifted his bags, knocked on the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Enter,&#x201d; came the crisp voice from within.<br><br>E. Lassiter was a tall, thin man with closely&#x2013;cropped blond hair. He stood up as Crane entered, came around his desk, shook hands. He wasn&#x2019;t wearing a military uniform, but with his haircut and his brisk, economical movements he might as well have been. The office was small and just as efficient&#x2013;looking as its tenant. The desk was almost studiously bare: there was a single manila envelope on it, carefully sealed, and a digital recorder.<br><br>&#x201c;You can stow your gear there,&#x201d; Lassiter said, indicating a far corner. &#x201c;Please sit down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Crane took the proffered seat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m eager to learn just what the emergency is. My escort here didn't have much to say on the subject.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, neither will I.&#x201d; Lassiter gave a brief smile, which disappeared as quickly as it came. &#x201c;That will come. My job is to ask you a few questions.&#x201d;<br><br>Crane digested this. &#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; he said after a moment.<br><br>Lassiter pressed a button on the recorder. &#x201c;This recording is taking place on June 2. Present are myself&#x2014;Edward Lassiter&#x2014;and Dr. Peter Crane. Location is the E. R. F. Support and Supply Station.&#x201d; Lassiter glanced over the desk at Crane. &#x201c;Dr. Crane, you are aware that your tour of service here cannot be fixed to a specific length?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you understand that you must never divulge anything you witness here, or recount your actions while at the Facility?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And are you willing to sign an affidavit to that effect?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Crane, have you ever been arrested?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Were you born a citizen of the United States, or are you naturalized?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was born in New York City.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you taking medication for any ongoing physical condition?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you abuse alcohol or drugs with any regularity?&#x201d;<br><br>Crane had fielded the questions with growing surprise. &#x201c;Unless you call the occasional weekend six&#x2013;pack &#x2018;abuse&#x2019;, then no.&#x201d;<br><br>Lassiter didn&#x2019;t smile. &#x201c;Are you claustrophobic, Dr. Crane?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>Lassiter put the recorder on pause. Then he picked up the manila envelope, slit it open with a finger, pulled out half a dozen sheets of paper, and passed them across the table. &#x201c;If you could please read and sign each of these,&#x201d; he said, plucking a pen from a pocket and placing it beside the sheets.<br><br>Crane picked them up and began to read. As he did so, his surprise turned to something close to disbelief. There were three separate non&#x2013;disclosure agreements, an Official Secrets Act affidavit, and something called a Binding Cooperation Initiative. All were branded documents of the U.S. Government; all required signature; and all threatened dire consequences if any of their articles were breached.<br><br>Crane put the documents down. He was uncomfortably aware of Lassiter&#x2019;s gaze upon him. This was too much. Maybe he should thank Lassiter politely, then excuse himself and head back to Florida.<br><br>But how, exactly, was he going to do that? AmShale had already paid a great deal of money to get him here. The helicopter had already left. He was&#x2014;to put it euphemistically&#x2014;between research projects at the moment. And besides, he had never been one to turn down a challenge: especially one as mysterious as this.<br><br>He picked up the pen and, without giving himself time to reconsider, signed all six documents.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Lassiter said. He started the recorder again. &#x201c;Let the transcript show that Dr. Crane has signed the requisite forms.&#x201d; Then, snapping off the recorder, he stood. &#x201c;If you'll follow me, Doctor, I think you'll get your answers.&#x201d;<br><br>He led the way out of the office and down the corridor, through a labyrinthine administrative area, up an elevator, and into a well&#x2013;furnished library, stocked with books, magazines, and computer workstations. Lassiter gestured toward a table on the far side of the room, which held only a computer monitor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come back for you,&#x201d; he said, then turned on his heel and left the room.<br><br>Crane sat where directed, watching the door close behind Lassiter. There was nobody else in the library, and he was beginning to wonder what would happen next, when the computer screen winked on in front of him. It showed the face of a grey&#x2013;haired, deeply tanned man in his late sixties. <i>Some kind of introductory video</i>, Crane thought. But when the face smiled directly at him, he realized he wasn't looking at a computer m...</p><h2>God&#39;s Power to Change Your Life (Living with Purpose)</h2><p>&#39;In the years I have been a pastor,&#39; writes Rick Warren, &#39;the number-one question I&#39;m asked is, &#39;Rick, why can&#39;t I change?&#39;&#39; People want to change---but they&#39;re stuck.

Chef Mesnier includes tips on techniques, ingredients, and serving suggestions, and offers home cooks practical advice, such as how to fill and use a pastry bag and the best way to whip egg whites. A resource list is also included, so cooks can find the more unusual ingredients they need to make these delectable creations.<br> <br>Mesnier starts off with his fresh-fruit desserts, including uniquely wonderful recipes such as Bananas in Raspberry Cream, Blueberry Fool, and Poached Peaches with Chestnut Mousse. He moves on to creamy custards, puddings, souffl�s, mousses and Bavarians, ice creams, meringues, cr�pes, and breakfast treats (including buttery brioche and croissant doughs). Chef Mesnier's cookie and bar recipes will fill your cookie jar with such treats as Chocolate Chip Cookies, Almond Crescents, Orange Butter Cookies, Brownies, and Florentine Squares.

National ad/promo.</p><p>Life with father, glossing over the bad times and trumpeting the good. Although billed as a memoir of her father, this is really Barrett's story, a recreation of a protected world of family, and friends, and small, youthful follies. Irving Berlin (18881989) was nearly 40 and already a successful songwriter when he eloped with the 23-year-old society belle Ellin MacKay. The story was widely covered because of the disparity in their backgrounds: he, a Lower East Side Jewish immigrant who worked in the lowly field of ``entertainment''; she, the daughter of wealth and privilege, whose Catholic father cut her out of his will when he learned of her marriage. Their first daughter, Mary Ellin, was born 11 months later, in 1926, and this memoir-autobiography primarily covers the period from her childhood to her marriage. Thus, she misses the dramatic story of Berlin's rise to the top as a Broadway composer; indeed, the coverage of Berlin the musician is slight, limited mostly to memories of opening night jitters and faint tinklings coming from the pianist's study. Barrett touches upon her father's early Hollywood years in the late '20s and early '30s, including his famous scores for the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers vehicles Follow the Fleet and Top Hat, his prewar Broadway triumphs, particularly the hit As Thousands Cheer, a detailed account of his World War IIera labor-of-love production of This Is the Army, taking him to the battlefields of Italy and the South Pacific as performer/promoter/songwriter, his postwar hits, including the classic Annie Get Your Gun, and his final slide into retirement. There are glimpses of Berlin's business dealings, but only as distant rumbles that sometimes disturbed domestic life. Berlin is portrayed as an intensely private, troubled man, either manically creative or deeply depressed, suffering from chronic insomnia, who had only a scanty relationship with his daughter. This memoir succeeds on a small scale, as a daughter's reach across time to recapture her childhood and make a final attempt to connect with her father.

All rights reserved.</i>Irving Berlin's (1888-1989) oldest daughter here tells of growing up with the composer of some of America's most popular songs, including "White Christmas," "God Bless America" and "Easter Parade." Barrett (An Accident of Love) details her parents' well-publicized romance and marriage, which scandalized her mother's family, and describes life in a household with a Catholic mother from one of the country's wealthiest families and a Jewish father who earned millions with his music though his parents were penniless Russian immigrants. It was a storybook childhood, with loving parents, governesses and innumerable servants; homes in Los Angeles, the Catskills and New York City; and daily contact with the rich and the famous. Yet there was a dark side: the death of the Berlins' infant son; "dry spells" when the composer could not write; and periods of depression for both him and his wife, culminating in his later years as a virtual recluse. Barrett's bittersweet memoir is affectionate yet candid.

Outside that again is the Transcend, full of unguessable, godlike "Powers." When human meddling wakes an old Power, the Blight, this spreads like a wildfire mind virus that turns whole civilizations into its unthinking tools. And the half-mythical Countermeasure, if it exists, is lost with two human children on primitive Tines World. </p><p> Serious complications follow. One paranoid alien alliance blames humanity for the Blight and launches a genocidal strike. Pham Nuwen, the man who knows about Countermeasure, escapes this ruin in the spacecraft <i>Out of Band</i>--heading for more violence and treachery, with 500 warships soon in hot pursuit. On his destination world, the fascinating Tines are intelligent only in combination: named "individuals" are small packs of the doglike aliens. Primitive doesn't mean stupid, and opposed Tine leaders wheedle the young castaways for information about guns and radios. Low-tech war looms, with elaborately nested betrayals and schemes to seize <i>Out of Band</i> if it ever arrives. The tension becomes extreme... while half the Beyond debates the issues on galactic Usenet. </p><p> Vinge's climax is suitably mindboggling. This epic combines the flash and dazzle of old-style space opera with modern, polished thoughtfulness. Pham Nuwen also appears in the nifty prequel set 30,000 years earlier, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>.

Responding to the crippled ship's distress signal, a rescue mission races against time to retrieve the children and recover the weapon they need to prevent the universe form being forever changed. Against a background depicting a space-time continuum stratified into 'zones of thought,' the author has created a rarity--a unique blend of hard science, high drama, and superb storytelling." --<i>Library Journal</i></p><p> "A tale that burns with the brazen energy of the best space operas of the golden age.

Her fiction has won national awards from the Faulkner Society and the National Endowment for the Arts. She teaches creative writing in Clinton, New York (where she lives with her husband and two sons), and Montolieu, France.A pleasantly unpolemical, if plodding, novel about a 21st-century abortionist who's haunted by the memory of her political-activist sister. It's the year 2026, and the world is a Gingrichian vision of high-tech gadgetry and conservative social values. Abortion is illegal and birth control scarce--as much from fear of declining birth rates among the white middle class as from Christian moral precepts. In this repressive but nominally democratic America, Phoebe has a day job as a computer debugger; secretly, she performs ``misconceptions,'' as illicit abortions are called. No abortion- rights crusader, Phoebe refers to her work as ``killing babies'' and continues mainly to carry on the legacy of her spirited older sister, Marie, a ``misconceiver'' who died in jail. Phoebe's brother and mother are also dead, and her father suffers from advanced Alzheimer's, so when the suicide of a 12-year-old incest victim throws her into a moral crisis, she turns to her widowed sister-in-law, Roxanne, for a place to lie low for a while. But while visiting Roxanne in California, Phoebe is moved by the plight of Roxanne's teenage daughter, Christel, who's facing an unwanted pregnancy. With the help of Roxanne's fianc&#x201a; Arthur, a doctor, Phoebe performs an abortion on her niece--and Phoebe and Arthur begin an affair. Arriving back home in Utica, Phoebe is immediately arrested and must figure out who has betrayed her. Was it Arthur, one of the friends or colleagues in whom she's confided, or perhaps a traitor in the underground community of abortion providers? Then a fellow prisoner helps her escape, and Phoebe has to consider how far she wants to go in service of Marie's cause. Ferriss (Against Gravity, 1996, etc.) worthily acknowledges the complexities of the abortion debate, and her dystopia, if not wildly original, is thoroughly imagined--yet ultimately the tale remains constrained by its narrow focus and muddled plot. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL.</p><h2>Trespass: Living at the Edge of the Promised Land</h2><p>Trespass is the story of one woman's struggle to gain footing in inhospitable territory. A wilderness activist and apostate Mormon, Amy Irvine sought respite in the desert outback of southern Utah's red-rock country after her father's suicide, only to find out just how much of an interloper she was among her own people. But more than simply an exploration of personal loss, Trespass is an elegy for a dying world, for the ruin of one of our most beloved and unique desert landscapes and for our vanishing connection to it. Fearing what her father's fate might somehow portend for her, Irvine retreated into the remote recesses of the Colorado Plateau--home not only to the world's most renowned national parks but also to a rugged brand of cowboy Mormonism that stands in defiant contrast to the world at large. Her story is one of ruin and restoration, of learning to live among people who fear the wilderness the way they fear the devil and how that fear fuels an antagonism toward environmental concerns that pervades the region. At the same time, Irvine mourns her own loss of wildness and disconnection from spirituality, while ultimately discovering that the provinces of nature and faith are not as distinct as she once might have believed.<br><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Formerly a nationally ranked competitive rock climber, <b>Amy Irvine</b> was for five years the Development Director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.Prologue<br>My home is a red desert that trembles with spirits and bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are two reasons I came here: my father&#x2019;s death, and the lion man who prowled my dreams. Perhaps it was coincidence, but a man&#x2014;half wild, ravenous beyond words&#x2014;slid from the dream world into the mud of the waking one the same year my father left this world for another.<br>Ghosts. Paw prints. I have tried to stay put.<br>The lion man is Herb. His name, his grandfather&#x2019;s. It doesn&#x2019;t quite suit him, but then, nothing about the civilized world does. Even my mother, who prefers all things tame, cannot accept it. Instead, she calls him Red for his long copper curls, for the heart pulsing on his sleeve. His eyes are a piercing topaz. And he purrs of dimensions other than this one&#x2014;says he sees and hears things differently and that&#x2019;s why he makes up his own rules. Me, I am at a loss for words. After contending daily with the lion man&#x2019;s incorrigible ways, I still don&#x2019;t know what to call him.<br>If Herb is red, then my father was blue. Perpetually immersed in water and nostalgia, to the point of inertia, he passed the days hunting&#x2014;mostly in cattails on the edge of the Great Salt Lake, just outside Salt Lake City. There he sat motionless, as if he could halt time. It was his attempt to deny the seductive sirens of civility&#x2014;their incessant beckonings to behave, to belong. He acted as if all that mattered was the water, and the sound of wings flapping overhead. He was a good shot.<br>But he lost his fluidity. The lake swelled, then retreated. Constrained by convention, dulled by bourbon, his primal reflexes failed. When the banks of soft marsh mud imploded beneath his feet, he simply could not respond. Finally, on the first night of the new millennium, as the rest of the world toasted a new era, my father put a bullet through his own heart.<br>the redrock desert where I made my home sits on a tall, arid land mass called the Colorado Plateau. This physiographic province sprawls across northern New Mexico and Arizona, western Colorado, and nearly all of the southern half of Utah&#x2014;my home state. Perhaps the most isolated portion of the Plateau falls within the boundaries of San Juan County, in Utah&#x2019;s southeastern corner. After my thirty-four years in Salt Lake City&#x2014;the state&#x2019;s urban capital, at the base of the Wasatch Mountains, in the northern region of the state&#x2014;this remote and rural portion of the desert was a welcome change.<br>San Juan County is the size of three small New England states. And of its 7,884 square miles, only 8 percent of the land is owned privately. The rest is either Indian or federal land&#x2014;managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and the Forest Service. Included within these federal jurisdictions are Canyonlands National Park, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and Hovenweep and Natural Bridges National Monuments. Also included are two million acres of BLM lands with hardly any special designations&#x2014;loosely managed for &#x201c;multiple use,&#x201d; which means they can be utilized for grazing, mining, logging, and nearly any form of recreation.<br>So scenic are these lands that if any of them&#x2014;any at all&#x2014;could be acquired, they would be considered prime real estate. But San Juan County, by and large, is not for sale. The result: Less than two people per square mile. Not one shopping mall or gated community. Only two stoplights and a single liquor store.<br>But there are eleven Mormon churches&#x2014;three of them built right on Indian lands.<br>In the late autumn of our first year in San Juan County, Herb and I hiked into a deep canyon on Cedar Mesa&#x2014;the connective tissue between the Abajo Mountains and the San Juan River. It was a cold and gray afternoon; the cottonwood trees in the canyon bottom had lost their gold medallions and stood wretched. The birds were gone. Everything was stripped, utterly silent. We tiptoed across stones made sleek and spherical by flash floods. Herb stopped and looked up at an ancient Indian ruin, high on the ledge above us. Perhaps a thousand years old, its earthen walls still stood. The two windows were dark and hollow, like the eyes of an unlit jack-o&#x2019;-lantern.<br>The lion man turned to me, his eyes dilated in the fading light. He said, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever felt so alone.<br>I disagreed. The ghosts were everywhere, watching. And even their company would prove to be too much.<br>Soon afterward, Herb and I bought a cabin on ten acres. There were no phone lines, no power lines, no pipes to deliver water or gas. With no service to collect what we discarded, we were careful about what we used in the first place. And with scarcely an aquifer of groundwater in the bedrock beneath shallow soils, there was little point in drilling a well. Instead, we hauled water from town in an old pickup and stored it in a cistern.<br>In winter, the snow would come suddenly and pick dogfights with the sky. The wind would scream like a woman assaulted. On winter mornings, Herb and I wrestled beneath the covers, to see who must leave our bed to light the stove and scrape ice from the solar panels that stood in the yard like a broken-off piece of spaceship. Summers were just as trying. Mornings would heat up like a struck match, and by noon the sky was bruised with thunderheads. When we moved in, I had laughed at the three lightning rods on the tar-paper roof&#x2014;now I know they weren&#x2019;t the least bit excessive. The rain comes and goes so fast, often it does no good. In this redrock desert, only one thing is constant: Evaporation duels saturation&#x2014;a lesson on how easily matter can vaporize.<br>The cabin sat on the rim of a canyon, halfway between the towns of Blanding and Monticello. From the kitchen table was a stunning view&#x2014;thousands of acres of scarcely interrupted public land and Indian land, yawning south for over one hundred miles. In the middle of the view lies the Four Corners, where the Colorado Plateau states converge with rectilinear perfection. This ninety-degree meeting of state lines is arbitrary, and invisible to the eye. But each day, as the light shifted across the sky, I detected new canyons, new mesas. The bones of the earth illuminated.<br>It was my father&#x2019;s mother, Ada, who first brought me to this desert, who taught me what to look for. I was six years old when I first sat in red sand, leaning over her shoulder to watch as she painted land and sky. She loved the capricious geography&#x2014;how it rose and fell like the spikes and troughs on an erratic cardiogram. She pointed out the sagebrush plain that suddenly plunged one thousand feet into a canyon of bare pink stone, glistening with seeps and springs; the roiling river beneath a ragged, bloody spine of a steeply rising anticline; the expletive of a sandstone minaret, erupting from the desert floor like a bold stroke of red ink.<br>An artist of abstractions, Ada sometimes made the rock look like water. She taught me all that she learned from this place&#x2014;to look past the obvious, to see what might emerge at the edges.<br>There is only wind, water, and stone, Amy. Because of them, the desert is constantly undone.<br>She understood erosion. How the fierce winds&#x2014;Arctic air in winter, gulf streams in summer&#x2014;could scour away the soil until there was only bedrock. How the Dirty Devil, the Colorado, and the San Juan rivers&#x2014;opaque ribbons of chocolate and jade&#x2014;could gnaw at the sandy banks, granule by granule, until there was nothing left to stand on. How even the smallest seismic shift beneath the earth&#x2019;s crust could calve pinnacles from canyon walls, or unearth the remnants of ancient peoples.<br>Early on, I remember sitting on a sandy beach at Lake Powell, in Glen Canyon Recreation Area. On a pad of paper, my grandmother sketched the cliffs that rose from the depths of the water. They were the color of raw salmon flesh. Sunlight leaped from the water and bedazzled the walls. Suddenly she dropped her pastel crayon, held her hands up against the sun. The rays burned through the pale webs of skin between her fingers.<br>And color. It shifts. Light changes everything.<br>She marveled at how, in one hour, a single rock formation could run the gauntlet of reds, oranges, even purples. Each shade was so exquisite, she said, that it defied description&#x2014;or any other kind of human attempt at acquisition. This may have frustrated another observer, but in my grandmother&#x2019;s mind, that intangible, luminous fluidity was the key to liberation. An atheist, an aesthete, she never tried to reinvent. Instead, she unleashed her self on the canvas. In doing so, she managed to interpret the desert&#x2019;s sensuality, particle by particle. Back in Salt Lake, she presented her work in galleries. From desert to city. She glided effortlessly between two contradictory worlds, translating the liquid language of landscape&#x2014;a place others have called barren and harsh.<br>Moving to southern Utah, I imagined myself as Ada. A visionary who could see, interpret, the desert&#x2019;s nuances. A woman free to go anywhere the senses led. A woman who could sustain herself on beauty alone.<br>The desert&#x2019;s people seemed only a minor obstacle. Mostly cowboy, mostly Mormon, they have their own way of seeing things. But I am used to this: My mother&#x2019;s side of the family possesses the same peculiar brand of faith&#x2014;a rawhide religion unlike anything you see in places more verdant, more populated. On public lands, in the high desert of southern Idaho&#x2014;in a place not at all unlike San Juan County&#x2014;they too run cattle and submit themselves not so much to the government as to God. I have spent my life among them, loving them. It made me believe my ...</p><h2>Mapping Manhattan: A Love (and Sometimes Hate) Story in Maps by 75 New Yorkers</h2><p>&nbsp; Armed with hundreds of blank maps she had painstakingly printed by hand, Becky Cooper walked Manhattan from end to end.

A lovingly re-imagined version of the author's native Waukegan, it has served as the setting for such modern classics as Dandelion Wine, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and Farewell Summer . In Summer Morning, Summer Night, Bradbury returns to this signature locale with a generous new collection of twenty-seven stories and vignettes, seventeen of which have never been published before. Together, they illuminate some of Green Town's previously hidden corners, and reaffirm Bradbury's position as the undisputed master of a unique fictional universe.<br><br>In the course of this volume, readers will encounter a gallery of characters brought vividly to life by that indefinable Bradbury magic. Included among them are a pair of elderly sisters whose love potion carries an unexpected consequence; a lonely teacher who discovers love on Green Town's nocturnal streets; a ten-year-old girl who literally unearths the intended victim of a vicious crime; and an aging man who recreates his past with the aid of a loaf of pumpernickel bread.<br><br>Each of these stories is engaging, evocative, and deeply felt. Each reflects the characteristic virtues that have always marked the best of Bradbury's fiction: optimism, unabashed nostalgia, openness to experience, and, most centrally, an abiding generosity of spirit. Summer Morning, Summer Night is both an unexpected gift and a treasure trove of Story. Its people, places, images, and events will linger in the reader's mind for many years to come.</p><p>In the hearts and minds of Bradbury enthusiasts, Green Town, Illinois, is as treasurable in fantastic literature as Baum&#x2019;s Emerald City or Lewis&#x2019; Narnia. Modeled after the author&#x2019;s boyhood home of Waukegan, idyllic midwestern Green Town was the setting for Bradbury&#x2019;s novels Dandelion Wine (1957) and Something Wicked This Way Comes (1962) as well as a handful of short stories. Until now most of those tales remained unpublished, an oversight Bradbury here rectifies in a welcome return to Green Town&#x2019;s secret haunts and assorted eccentric citizens. A lonely teacher walks the town&#x2019;s nocturnal streets pursuing an impossible romance with a night-shift rail-yard worker. After a broken engagement, a woman removes all her porch steps and barricades herself in an old Victorian house until her long-lost fianc� finally returns. Stories about love potions and aging couples trying to recapture their pasts mingle with shorter vignettes about passing circuses and the poignant fading of summer. Bradbury&#x2019;s familiar poetic magic sings in every paragraph, reminding his readers why Green Town is worth visiting again and again. --Carl HaysStarred Review. As intoxicating as Bradbury's legendary <i>Dandelion Wine</i>, the 27 new and old stories in this potent collection resonate with timeless power. All set in Green Town, Ill., the vintage highlights include "Miss Bidwell," a sweet romance about a spinster and the delayed homecoming of her first love; the brilliant "The Screaming Woman," featuring the wide-eyed first person narration of a frantic 10-year-old who discovers a woman's premature burial; and "At Midnight, in the Month of June," in which a killer plays a demented game of hide and seek. Contemporary one-page shorts such as "The River that Went to the Sea" and "The Projector" round out a lyrical feast with the savor of "apricots and fresh apples and as water tastes when you rise at night and walk into a dark warm summer kitchen and drink from a cool tin cup." <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to the oppressive Roman military occupation of the first century, he examines the meaning of the non-violent Kingdom of God prophesized by Jesus and the equality advocated by Paul to the early Christian churches. Crossan contrasts these messages of peace with the misinterpreted apocalyptic vision from the Book of Revelation, which has been misrepresented by modern right-wing theologians and televangelists to justify U.S. military actions in the Middle East.</p><p>In <em>God and Empire</em> Crossan surveys the Bible from Genesis to Apocalypse, or the Book of Revelation, and discovers a hopeful message that cannot be ignored in these turbulent times. The first-century Pax Romana, Crossan points out, was in fact a "peace" won through violent military action. Jesus preached a different kind of peace&#x2014;a peace that surpasses all understanding&#x2014;and a kingdom not of Caesar but of God. </p><p>The Romans executed Jesus because he preached this Kingdom of God, a kingdom based on peace and justice, over the empire of Rome, which ruled by violence and force. For Jesus and Paul, Crossan explains, peace cannot be won the Roman way, through military victory, but only through justice and fair and equal treatment of all people.</p></p><p><p>John Dominic Crossan, professor emeritus at DePaul University, is widely regarded as the foremost historical Jesus scholar of our time. He is the author of several bestselling books, including <em>The Historical Jesus</em>, <em>How to Read the Bible and Still Be a Christian, God and Empire</em>, <em>Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography</em>, <em>The Greatest Prayer, The Last Week, </em>and <em>The Power of Parable</em>. He lives in Minneola, Florida.</p>*Starred Review* By Crossan's lights, Jesus proposed the nonviolent kingdom of God to supplant Rome. And not just Rome but civilization per se may be the object of Jesus' revolution, for civilization building was Rome's pretext for imperial aggression and economic as well as physical violence against common people. Fighting Rome was folly, so the kingdom of God movement aimed to liberate ordinary people nonviolently. It threatened Rome because Jesus' proclamation of God defied the Roman emperor's institutional divinity, and because Jesus proposed peace through justice against Rome's conceit that it achieved peace through the violence of conquest. Paul sharpened the concept of equality in the kingdom of God by advocating for slaves and cooperating on equal terms with women; here Crossan goes Garry Wills' <i>What Paul Meant</i> (2006) one better by carefully explaining that pro-slavery and anti-women Pauline remarks come from epistles spuriously attributed to him. Later, the Revelation of John promulgated a "pornography of violence" and has malevolently affected Christianity ever since, most recently in rapture theology, whose influence on U.S. neoconservatives' bush-league Rome is the immediate provocation for this book. The opposition of God and empire, of justice and violence, persists. Despite a few rant-lines from the progressives' book of cant, this book makes the best reading for the most readers of any that Crossan has written. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Brought back to life on an operating room table after a horrific car crash, Father Paul Bartholomew is haunted by frightening visions&#x2014;especially the moments when he seems to inhabit the body of Christ at Golgotha. The skeptics. . . . Dr. Stephen Castle, a New York City psychiatrist and renowned atheist, has built an international reputation for his book arguing that religion is a figment of human imagination. Professor Marco Gabrielli, an Italian religious researcher and chemist, has made a career of debunking supposed miracles, of explaining the unexplainable. The miracle. . . . For centuries, however, the Shroud of Turin has defied scientific explanation. Is this ancient remnant that bears such a vividly detailed pictorial representation truly the burial cloth that wrapped Christ after he was taken down from the cross? Or is it the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the Christian community? As Father Bartholomew&#x2014;newly returned to his parish, the venerable St. Joseph&#x2019;s Church in upper Manhattan&#x2014;celebrates Mass, blood starts running down his arm. The horrified congregation watches him collapse to the ground, his vestments soaked with the blood pouring from wounds on his wrists. The phenomenon is known as stigmata, when a person appears to manifest the wounds that Christ suffered upon the cross. But in Father Bartholomew&#x2019;s case there is a mysterious added dimension: he has been transformed to resemble in almost every physical aspect the Christ-like figure represented on the Shroud of Turin. Worried that Bartholomew&#x2019;s case could be proved a hoax, the Vatican employs Dr. Castle and Professor Gabrielli to investigate. But for the well-known psychiatrist and the experienced man of science both, Father Bartholomew presents the most perplexing challenge either has ever faced. Dr. Castle watches in person while the priest appears to writhe in agony, blood spurting from wounds identical to those portrayed on the famous shroud, and he wonders if he too can have been sucked into some kind of shared hallucination. Meanwhile, Professor Gabrielli&#x2014;confident that he can reproduce the shroud by using materials and methods available in the Middle Ages&#x2014;works frantically to prove that the shroud is a medieval forgery. <p>But when the priest&#x2019;s uncanny resemblance to the crucified Christ on the Shroud prompts the two men to investigate the famous artifact itself, each is finally forced to face mysteries that cannot be explained by sheer reason alone. It will be the most unsettling&#x2014;and eventually soul-wrenching&#x2014;journey of discovery they have ever undertaken. </p><p>From Jerome R.

Easily, he moved upward, leaving behind the police and ambulance sirens below, as rescue workers rushed to the scene. </p><p>Ahead of him, he could see the purest of white light streaming from a tunnel that loomed in the sky above him. </p><p>In the depths of his soul he felt a peace he had never felt before, a peace he had always longed to feel. He was happy to be free of his broken body and he felt no sorrow at leaving his life behind. </p><p>As he entered the tunnel, the luminescence surrounded him. He held his hands in front of his face and turned them so he could see his palms. He was intact. He felt his legs and they too were fine. He was uninjured. </p><p>He wondered, Why am I surprised? </p><p>Then the car crash flashed back to him in horrific detail. </p><p>He had been at the wheel of his car, applying the brakes as hard as he could. He had just come around a sharp curve to find ahead of him two semi-trucks jackknifed together in a multiple-vehicle wreck that blocked both lanes of the interstate. </p><p>As if watching a movie, he saw himself behind the wheel of his car, screaming and bracing for the impact. At sixty-five miles per hour, the hood of his car crushed back upon him like an accordion. The impact was a more powerful jolt than he had ever imagined possible. </p><p>An unexpected summer thunderstorm had sent a driving rain down on the highway and he should have known to slow down, but he was preoccupied, lost in thought, totally unaware of the oil on the highway that had turned slick in the rain, causing the trucks ahead of him to collide and jackknife, setting off a chain reaction of a dozen more vehicles. </p><p>Yes, that afternoon, Father Paul Bartholomew, a Catholic priest, died. </p><p>The police report would read that he was killed in a motor vehicle accident at 3:35 P.M. ET on August 15. </p><p>He died on the operating room table after the horrific car crash he suffered while driving that Sunday afternoon to the cabin in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, where he had spent summers as a boy. </p><p>But now all that seemed like a dream. The luminescence in the tunnel surrounded him like a fog and he felt drawn to move forward. </p><p>As he approached the end of the tunnel, he could see people milling about. Strangely, they all seemed to be floating with the light and the fog enveloping them. Vaguely he thought he could detect friends and relatives who had been dead now for many years. </p><p>Suddenly, he was thrilled to see his mother coming forward to embrace him. His mother had died ten years earlier of Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s disease, a progressive nerve disease in which the brain loses the ability to move the body&#x2019;s muscles. The disease took five years to kill her and in the last two months of her life her paralysis increased to near total. </p><p>Paul at that time was on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He was the youngest physicist ever to be asked to join the esteemed institute. Before his mother&#x2019;s illness, Dr. Bartholomew was considered one of the most promising young physicists in the world. </p><p>When his mother was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, his life was shattered. Six months before she died, he moved his mother out of the hospital and brought her back home, where he hired nurses around the clock to care for her. As his mother&#x2019;s paralysis became complete in her final days of life, the institute gave Bartholomew a leave of absence. He never left his mother&#x2019;s side until she died; he moved a small cot into her room so he could take care of her in the middle of the night. He prayed that God would take him and spare his mother. </p><p>Then, as she went into a coma, he spent hours at her bedside, holding her hand, trying to communicate with her one last time. In the middle of the night, as she took her final labored breaths, Bartholomew wiped her brow with a cold cloth, trying to ease her pain. When she died, he felt desolate and abandoned, his tears unable to bring her back or express his pain. At her funeral, Bartholomew wished there was a way he could join her in death, and he would have, except he felt it was against God&#x2019;s law for him to commit suicide. </p><p>The death of his mother marked a turning point in Bartholomew&#x2019;s life. What kept him going was a determination to understand what his life was about. Why was he here on earth in this here and now? He had no ready answer. </p><p>In the depths of his crisis, he railed against God for taking from him the only person in his life who truly understood him. As he grieved his loss, he realized he had gone into physics in an attempt to find God, and now, with the despair he felt with his mother gone, he was ending up with nothing. Regardless of how brilliant he had been in science, having received his Ph.D. from Princeton when he was only twenty-five years-old, the death of his mother made him realize that God could not be found in a particle accelerator or a quantum equation. The head of the physics department was shocked when Bartholomew came into his office and announced he had decided to resign from the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study. </p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean you want to resign?&#x201d; asked Dr. Horton Silver, himself a renowned physicist and Bartholomew&#x2019;s most trusted advisor at the university. &#x201c;Your appointment at the Institute is an appointment for life. Your particle physics work has broken new ground internationally. You can&#x2019;t resign.&#x201d; </p><p>Dr. Silver was right. Bartholomew was on the verge of a major theoretical breakthrough dealing with one of the most important unanswered mysteries that had eluded the most brilliant minds in physics since Einstein had been at the very same institute. Bartholomew had spent the last three years developing a series of equations that Silver felt were the most promising approach he had yet seen to explain the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, a quantum physics problem: if the position of a particle were known, its momentum could not be determined with precision. Dr. Silver believed Bartholomew would solve the problem and that if he abandoned physics now, it might be decades before another physicist emerged who was brilliant enough to tackle the problem and advance beyond the progress Bartholomew had made. </p><p>Silver refused to accept Bartholomew&#x2019;s decision. Instead he insisted that Bartholomew take some time off to get himself back together emotionally. They had known each other since Bartholomew was an undergraduate in one of Silver&#x2019;s advanced physics courses at Princeton. He encouraged Bartholomew to pursue graduate studies in physics and when Bartholomew was accepted as a graduate student in physics, Silver became his advisor. </p><p>&#x201c;Your leaving physics will be a great loss both to physics and to the institute,&#x201d; Silver insisted. &#x201c;Travel. Go to Europe for a few months. You need some time to grieve. When you get back, you&#x2019;ll be ready to resume your work.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve made my decision and it&#x2019;s final,&#x201d; Bartholomew explained to Dr. Silver. &#x201c;I have come to the conclusion that I have made all the contributions to physics that I want to make.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean? You&#x2019;re already famous and you&#x2019;re not yet at the height of your career.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That may be, but my decision is final.&#x201d; </p><p>Dr. Silver finally had to accept the fact that he could not change Bartholomew&#x2019;s mind. </p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to do with the rest of your life?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a young man, not yet forty years old. You can&#x2019;t mourn your mother for the rest of your life.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided to go into the priesthood,&#x201d; Bartholomew said without hesitation. &#x201c;I have come to the conclusion that I have to find God and that physics isn&#x2019;t going to get me there.&#x201d; </p><p>Silver was flabbergasted. &#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re dropping out altogether then?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Bartholomew protested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not dropping out. It&#x2019;s just the opposite. I think for the first time in my life I know what I&#x2019;m doing. My mother always told me that I had a vocation for the priesthood and I had never believed her. If she communicated anything to me in the last days of her life, even if it was just with her eyes before she went into a coma, she was telling me I had to find God. She always said I was born to do something in my life more important than physics. Now I believe her.&#x201d; </p><p>THE DAY OF the car accident was a Sunday. After saying Mass that morning at his parish, St. Joseph&#x2019;s on New York City&#x2019;s Upper East Side, he drove over to his mother&#x2019;s grave site in Morristown, New Jersey. He brought fresh flowers to place on her grave, as he always did. Kneeling at his mother&#x2019;s grave that morning, he prayed for her soul and asked God once more that he might join her soon. </p><p>Little did Bartholomew realize, as he left the cemetery in Morristown to head up to his cabin, that this was to be the last day of his life. </p><p>Now, surrounded by the luminescence in what he imagined must be Heaven, Bartholomew and his mother embraced for what seemed the longest time, thrilled to be reunited. </p><p>&#x201c;Come with me, Paul,&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s someone else who has been waiting here for you, along with me.&#x201d; </p><p>She took his hand and together they approached a man seated at a table. </p><p>Bartholomew felt this man was the oldest and wisest man he had ever seen.

(Hal Kanter, Director of the Elvis film <i>Loving You<i>)</i></i></i></i>Elvis's manager gets a good skewering in this uneven biography by Dickerson (That's Alright, Elvis, with Scotty Moore), a veteran Nashville writer. The strength of the book lies in its early pages, when Dickerson traces Parker's sketchy background in the circus and his rise as a country music manager. The circus business gave him the ideas, Dickerson persuasively argues, that he later effectively used as a music promoter. But throughout the book, Dickerson's judgment is questionable. He argues that both Parker and Elvis were Jewish, but provides weak evidence on both accounts. And after the Dutch-born Parker designated a colonel by a Kentucky governor takes over Elvis's career in the mid-1950s, Dickerson exhibits little of the sympathy biographers usually feel for their subjects. Instead, he blames Parker for Elvis's ruin: "Rather than risk losing his interest in Elvis's contract to his creditors, Parker allowed Elvis to risk losing his career." Even if the colonel did push Elvis into some disastrous film roles to cover some of his own gambling debts, Parker deserves some credit for Presley's rise to demigod status, as Dickerson's own account shows ("Parker's decision to accept RCA's offer was the best thing that could have happened for Elvis' career.... ") There's little doubt that Parker was a shady character plagued by gambling problems, who tried to take advantage of Elvis. But readers hoping for a balanced account of the relationship will be disappointed. 35 pages b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. (May)Forecast: Elvis remains such a national obsession that any book promising a little-explored angle has some commercial potential. But this one won't register on most fans' radars, for true Elvis followers prefer not to have their king upstaged, especially by the man many think betrayed him. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Land of Dreams: An Israeli Childhood</h2><p>This memoir, written by a native son, recalls everyday life before, during, and after the birth of the State of Israel.</p><p>Mordecai SchreiberAn intermittently engaging memoir recollecting the difficult birth of the State of Israel, by a novelist and translator. The best parts are Schreiber's childhood memories of Jewish-Arab Haifa and his impressions of the Jewish state's struggle for independence. The reader gains an element of unencumbered honesty from the author's perspective as an eight-year-old but loses much in forgotten or unlived detail, because Schreiber was too young to participate in or understand much of his era's drama. His father was a principle figure in the pre-state colony, smuggling arms in his fishing truck before joining the ragtag, fledgling army that became the Israeli Defense Forces. Schreiber also offers some engaging scenes of what it was like for longtime settlers in Palestine to cope with a constant influx of refugees. He expresses sorrow that the Arabs didn't show similar hospitality to their refugeessome of whom were his childhood friends from nearby Arab Haifa. A pursuer of peace, Schreiber regrets that the Arabs didn't get their own state. The book comes alive in its anecdotes: Some Holocaust survivors, for instance, excelled in the black market. Schreiber also catches how the long struggle to create and protect the nation took its toll on some of its citizens; many members of his generation, he notes, burned out and emigrated. The second, post-independence half of the memoir is weaker, more maudlin and repetitive. Schreiber's energy picks up when the topic is politics. He argues with some vigor that Menachem Begin was a better man than either David Ben-Gurion (``not a very likable person'') or Yitzhak Rabin, noting that ``it was left to others, who did not preach socialism, to be more kind and social.'' A memoir of early Israel of uneven literary and historical worth. (b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

All seven grades of this method are written in standard notation only to encourage better sight reading. In Grade 1, the student guitarist will learn to play solos, duets, scales, and chords in the keys of C, A minor, G and E minor. Even in Grade 1, the student is already exposed to the chord/melody concept of guitar performance. A supplementary study book entitled Grade 1 Studies, two different play-along audio recordings (pop version and traditional), and a video are available. The companion recordings feature Tommy Flint and William Bay playing in split-track format, with the solo parts performed on the right channel, and the accompaniment or second duet parts played on the left. The student can play along with the full recording, or tune out either channel and play the missing part.</p><p>Mel Bay was born on February 25, 1913 in the little Ozark Mountain town of Bunker, Missouri. He bought a Sears Roebuck guitar at the age of 13 and several months later played his first &#34;gig.&#34; (He recalled playing until his fingers were raw!) Mel took up the tenor banjo shortly thereafter and continued to play both instruments. During his teenage years Mel played with a wild assortement of bands and characters in rural Missouri. Perhaps no &#34;gig&#34; was as strange as the job he landed with, in Mel&#39;s words, &#34;a snake oil salesman.&#34; This flamboyant peddler would pull his ostentatious Pierce Arrow automobile, complete with steer horns mounted on the grill, into the center of a small, rural town. Mel would sit on the car and play up a storm on the tenor banjo. After a crowd gathered, the peddler took over and began extolling the merits of his &#34;wonder elixer.&#34; In 1933 Mel Bay moved to St. Louis and began his professional career. He played with numerous local and traveling bands. In addition, he landed staff guitar jobs on several radio stations. Mel fronted his own trio (piano, bass, guitar) and played steadily for 25 years! He was equally adept on most fretted instruments and played mandolin, uke, Hawaiian guitar, tenor and plectrum banjo professionally. While Mel was actively pursuing his playing career, he continued to teach as many as 100 students a week. He decided to begin writing instructional materials due to the difficulty encountered by guitarists at playing good sounding chord forms in rhythm sections and due to the poor note reading ability prevalent among guitarists. After the war Mel was asked to write instructional materials on guitar for GI&#39;s wanting to learn music under the GI Bill. In 1947 Mel formed his own publishing company and wrote his landmark initial book titled The Orchestral Chord System for Guitar. (This book is still in print under the title Rhythm Guitar Chord System and continues to be one the finest rhythm guitar chord texts available!) His Modern Guitar Method was penned shortly thereafter. For years Mel traveled from town to town talking to guitar teachers and players and showing them his publications. At one time Mel claims to have known virtually every guitar teacher in America on a first name basis! The guitar and Mel Bay books caught on in a big way in the 1950&#39;s. Things have continued to grow ever since. Mel used to sell D&#39;Angelico guitars. At any given time he would have 5 or 6 &#34;lying around the house.&#34; Mel played professionally on his New Yorker model but his favorite was the initial Mel Bay Model crafted as a gift for him by John D&#39;Angelico. This famous guitar had all of the main features of the New Yorker but was a &#34;cut away&#34; model and had a slightly thinner neck. This instrument has been pictured on the Mel Bay Modern Guitar Method for decades. Someone once calculated that sales of guitar books written by Mel Bay have exceeded 25 million copies. When asked, Mel frequently said that he quit counting long ago. Sales of his Modern Guitar Method have alone surpassed the 7 million mark. It is safe to say that Mel Bay is one of the pivotal figures in the world of guitar music and instruction in this century.I was 17 years old teaching at Ernie Ball&#39;s Guitar Shop in Tarzana, California. That&#39;s where I met Mel Bay through a workshop he taught. It was then that I took myself through his 7 book guitar method the first time which was very instrumental toward my professional training. Now, all these years later just I completed the updated expanded edition of the 7 book method. It is a beautiful workout and journey of graded material including: 1. Reading studies in all keys and positions. 2.Beautiful chord melodies ranging from classical to folk, blues, jazz and latin in style. 3. Theory is an integral part of this method presenting harmonized chord forms, studies in thirds and triads and quartal harmony in all keys. 4. Technical development and challenge and strong musicality frame this great work. This production is in my opinion the consumate guitar method which I recommend as a must to all serious guitarists. Congratulations to William Bay for this masterpiece. --Michael Anthony</p><h2>Zephyr: Tracking a Dream Across America</h2><p>A journalist recounts his experiences and the people he met on a trip aboard Amtrak&#39;s California Zephyr as it traveled across America&#39;s most storied transcontinental rail route. 20,000 first printing. $20,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Kisor (What's That Pig Outdoors?, 1990) records his adventures on the California Zephyr, the legendary transcontinental train from Chicago to L.A. Kisor loves the train, the crew, the chefs, the porters, and the lore of the train that ranges from an odd sexual encounter in the baggage car to the effect of altitude on Alzheimer's, from train crashes and criminals to the history of dining cars. Kisor is especially knowledgeable about food, from the way it is gathered, cooked, and served to the way people are seated in the dining car. And there is much about toilets, the ``tidiness'' of those who can afford sleepers and the problems of plumbing. The author also has much to tell about mating rituals, the predatory nature of women especially, the charged atmosphere of the lounge car (``Casbah on Amtrak''), and sexuality in general from harassment to homophobia, including the obscure autobiography of a lesbian ``brakeman'' that Kisor narrates to a lesbian novelist who's his dinner companion and one of the few to be spared his judgmental--or his uncharitable and stereotyping--social observations. There is the ``rat-faced man'' who assumed a fraudulent identity, the ``human hedgehog'' adolescent with the Mohawk haircut, Mildred ``of the detachable virginity,'' and a transvestite dubbed ``Tootsie'' who plays a part in an ``amusing'' anecdote about trying to find a suitable dinner companion for Kisor. A chapter is devoted to the author's plans for writing a murder mystery and another to explaining why, as a lip- reading deaf person, he had to take along a translator. Presented as a microcosm in the tradition of Ship of Fools, this seems, rather, a petty and misogynistic take on the worthless passengers riding a great train served by a caring and conscientious crew. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>One would be lucky to draw Kisor as a seat partner on a long train trip, for this book-review editor of the Chicago Sun Times is deferential and polite, a master at consequential chit-chat and full of train lore, which he makes interesting whether or not you happen to share his ecstasy in rolling stock. And Kisor ( What's That Pig Outdoors? ) is seemingly expert at compensating for his deafness. Hours before he boards Amtrak's California Zephyr in Chicago, he wanders the train yards looking over the locomotives with an eye for their design and technology; then he checks out the Zephyr's kitchen, renews acquaintance with the chef and asks about the menus. So curious is Kisor about everything happening around him and about the train crew and passengers, who in short order tell him all about themselves, that the miles click away pleasurably. The Zephyr's timetable is scheduled to provide optimum daylight scenery, giving Kisor the opportunity to recall the history of the areas he passes through and to comment on the vistas. And there's rarely a boring lull because Kisor inevitably has something lively to say, whether it's about the local newspapers, train toilets or thermal baths. Readers will be sorry to leave his company at trip's end, in Oakland (mile 2416).

Adler was born in New York City, New York. He graduated from Queens College in 1968 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in economics and education. For the next nine years, he worked as a mathematics teacher for the New York City Board of Education, while taking classes towards a master&#39;s degree in marketing, a degree he was awarded by New York University in 1971. In that same year, a question from his then-three-year-old nephew inspired Adler to write his first story, A Little at a Time, subsequently published by Random House in 1976. Adler&#39;s next project, a series of math books, drew on his experience as a math teacher. In 1977, he created his most famous character, Cam Jansen, originally featured in Cam Jansen and the Mystery of the Stolen Diamonds, which was published that year. Adler married psychologist Renee Hamada in 1973, and their first child, Michael, was born in 1977. By that time Adler had taken a break from teaching and, while his wife continued her work, he stayed home, took care of Michael, and began a full-time writing career. Adler has three children and one grandson. He lives in Woodmere, New York.Adler, a prolific children's book author, has done a good job describing the trajectory of Douglass's life as he moved from being a slave himself to being a freer of slaves and a tireless civil rights activist. Adler includes interesting, often sobering facts that will strike home with children: Douglass's mother only saw him a few times in her life because she had to walk a total of 24 miles to visit him, and he grew up to the reality of slaves being beaten and abused. Narrator Charles Turner, who has a deep and resonant voice, uses just the right matter-of-fact yet serious tones that won't overwhelm young listeners but will make an impression on them.

In the 1970s he ran the Northwest and Western regional programs of The Nature Conservancy; in the 1980s he developed The Nature Conservancy international program and was founding president of Conservation International; today he is founder and president of Ecotrust, where his innovations include founding the world's first environmental bank; creating a range of programs in fisheries, forestry, food, and farms; establishing an annual awards program that honors and supports the work of indigenous people; and developing new scientific and information tools to improve social, economic, and environmental decision-making.<br><br> <i>Cache</i> not only recounts Beebe's personal journey, but also traces the parallel evolution of the environmental movement and provides fresh thinking about the road ahead.<br><br> It is a book for business people who wish to build businesses with more than the bottom-line in mind; for conservationists who wish to get practical results in a world not always sympathetic to their goals; and for people who simply love nature and, like Beebe, try to learn from it. <i>Cache</i> is, in Tom Brokaw's words, an "evocative and inspirational book."</p><p>Spencer B. Beebe is founder and president of Ecotrust in Portland, Oregon. Spencer earned degrees from Williams College and Yale School of Forestry, and has received two honorary doctorates. He served in the Peace Corps in Honduras, worked with The Nature Conservancy for thirteen years, and in 1987, became founding president of Conservation International. In 1991, he returned to his native Northwest to establish Ecotrust. Spencer is a backcountry pilot, fly fisherman, and fourth-generation Oregonian.

But <i>Cache</i> also maps Beebe's gradual understanding that the most sustainable preservation efforts need to begin with human economies -- a realization that ultimately led to the controversial 1987 "uprising" he led at the Nature Conservancy that resulted in his founding of Conservation International and, later, Ecotrust. --Portland Monthly</p><h2>Literature and Language Arts</h2><p>This item is in good condition</p><p></p><h2>Houghton Mifflin Science Alabama: Student Edition Grade 1 2007</h2><p>Never Been In Circulation.

Both are celebrated in <i>Provence the Beautiful Cookbook</i>, an oversized (more than two feet tall!) picture and cookbook of breathtaking color photos and authentic regional recipes. The 270 recipes, compiled and written by award-winning food book author Richard Olney, include soups and starters; seafood, meat, game, and poultry dishes; vegetable and grain specialties; and simple but luscious desserts. Readers seeking an armchair tour of the region, singularly depicted, and the chance to see and reproduce its dishes, will delight in the book, which would also make a welcome gift. <p> Beginning with an introduction to the land and its cooking, the book then weaves short essays about the Proven�al regions with recipes arranged by courses.

Learn from the best in Fish!</p><p>Here's another management parable that draws its lesson from an unlikely source--this time it's the fun-loving fishmongers at Seattle's Pike Place Market. In <i>Fish!</i> the heroine, Mary Jane Ramirez, recently widowed and mother of two, is asked to engineer a turnaround of her company's troubled operations department, a group that authors Stephen Lundin, Harry Paul, and John Christensen describe as a "toxic energy dump." Most reasonable heads would cut their losses and move on. Why bother with this bunch of losers? But the authors don't make it so easy for Mary Jane. Instead, she's left to sort out this mess with the help of head fishmonger Lonnie. Based on a bestselling corporate education video, <i>Fish!</i> aims to help employees find their way to a fun and happy workplace. While some may find the story line and prescriptions--such as "Choose Your Attitude," "Make Their Day," and "Be Present"--downright corny, others will find a good dose of worthwhile motivational management techniques.

Sovereignty. The book of Ruth entails them all. So readers shouldn't be fooled by its age, says Pastor John Piper. Though its events happened over 3,000 years ago, the story holds astounding relevance for Christians in the twenty-first century.<br><br> The sovereignty of God, the sexual nature of humanity, and the gospel of God's mercy for the undeserving-these massive realities never change. And since God is still sovereign, and we are male or female, and Jesus is alive and powerful, <em>A Sweet and Bitter Providence</em> bears a message for readers from all walks of life. But be warned, Piper tells his audience: This ancient love affair between Boaz and Ruth could be dangerous, inspiring all of us to great risks in the cause of love.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Piper</strong> (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org&nbsp;and the chancellor of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary.

Landes</b> is professor emeritus of history and economics at Harvard and author of the bestseller <i>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations</i>. His other books include <i>Bankers and Pashas, The Unbound Prometheus</i>, and <i>Revolution in Time.</i>Beginning as a work of economics, moving through soap opera and finishing as history, this book tells the stories of 11 great family businesses in Europe, Japan and America with at least three generations of family control. Observing that the vast majority of businesses are family owned and run, historian Landes (<i>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations</i>) argues that dynastic businesses offer a proven route to developing emerging markets, while companies managed by unrelated professionals and funded by public investors offer mostly bad jobs and slim profit shares to local employees. Even among the largest corporations, many retain significant financial and managerial involvement by the founder's relatives, and those that do perform better than the others. Landes's stories emphasize emotional life within these dynasties; he includes business details and general economic history only as context for family adventures and feuds. His emphasis is on how family considerations such as authority, love, trust, envy, marriage, adoption and succession determine the growth and direction of the business. While this may seem irrational compared to entrusting strategic decisions to specialized professionals selected according to talent rather than bloodline, Landes argues that family does a better job. <i>(Sept. 25)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He hasn't been much of a reader but this is the FIRST book he reads without prodding. He talks about it a lot and always tells me what happened. The chapters aren't too long or overwhelming for early chapter readers. An easy read. It's refreshing to find a fun, adventure book without a lot of 'dark' themes. A rare find!" - Summer Blue, parent<br><br>"Our night-time routine with our daughter and son (ages 7 and 5), is to read a book, watch a couple YouTube videos, talk about our day, and go to bed. This is the first book that had my kids begging to skip videos and talking time to just read a few more chapters." - Ian Fisher, parent<br><br>"My second-grader and I devoured the series this past school year!

Yes -- a kids book that I can enjoy as much as a 2nd grader? Those are so few and far between. I'm also a middle school teacher. I handed the first book to a really reluctant reader in my 7th grade class this year and he ended up asking me what the next book is called so he could ask his mom for it" - ErmarCar, middle school teacher<br><br>"This is one of the funnest sets of heroes I've encountered in some time, and this is one of the smartest [middle grade] action/adventure tales I've read, ever. It's entertaining but it also brings the reader into the fun of reading this kind of stuff, (without ever mocking the genre). The whole book has that kind of generous, knowing, upbeat, Boy's Own, vibe. ...The book delivered a ripping and amusing adventure in the company of some fine heroes.

Readers' Favorite</strong><br></p><p><strong>'47 DAYS' is a novelette and an excerpt from the award-winning biographical novel, SURVIVING THE FATHERLAND--A True Coming-of-age Love Story Set in WWII Germany.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>In March 1945 Hitler ordered his last propaganda command: send all 15 and 16-year old boys to defend the fatherland. 47 DAYS tells the true story of G�nter and Helmut, best friends, who dared to defy and disobey. Without knowing how long the war might continue, they spent 47 harrowing days as fugitives on the run. Being caught meant certain execution.<br><br>SURVIVING THE FATHERLAND tells the true and heart-wrenching stories of Lilly and G�nter struggling with the terror-filled reality of life in the Third Reich, each embarking on their own dangerous path toward survival, freedom, and ultimately each other. Based on the author's own family and anchored in historical facts, this story celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the strength of war children.</p></p><p>Based on my father's experience as a youth in World War II, 47 DAYS takes us into the last months of the war. The 'Reich' is crumbling, but Hitler frantically throws the last warm bodies into battle: old men, the injured and feeble, and all 15- and 16-year old boys. With the Allies and Russians spreading across German soil, it is a wasted effort. Hitler well knows it is too late and that the war is lost. But in his insane mind he justifies discarding the youth of the country. If Germany can't win, they can all go to hell.My father, G�nter, and his best friend, Helmut, were among those teens, drafted in March 1945. They were told to travel 200 kilometers south to report to the Hitler Youth Office in Marburg and jointedly defend the fatherland. Without training, without weapons. My father and his friend decided it was a bad idea. They chose to think for themselves and disobey. The prize was their lives because being caught meant certain execution.<br>At the time nobody knew how much longer the war would last. And so the task of hiding and eluding became a race for survival. Not to mention the turmoil G�nter and Helmut must have felt every single day. Had they done the right thing? Would they get caught? Well, they almost did. And they almost died.<br>I chose to publish this novelette separately because I wanted to share the conflict and threats these boys endured for disobeying orders. If you are interested in historical action/adventure and the state of Germany in the last months of World War II, this story may be of interest. I also believe it would be beneficial for high schoolers studying German history.<br><br>47 DAYS is an excerpt from the full-length novel, SURVIVING THE FATHERLAND. Defying Hitler's orders was my father's way to keep his sanity...and as it turns out, his life.&nbsp;Annette Oppenlander is an award-winning writer, literary coach and educator.

With her horrendous hairdo and two rabid robots, Wedgie Woman is well on her way to world domination, and only the Waistband Warrior can stop her!</p><p>In the fifth "epic novel" about the extraordinary Captain Underpants--"faster than a speeding waistband... more powerful than boxer shorts"--the formidable superhero is under siege by a terrifying new enemy, the merciless bionic-powered Wedgie Woman. Will Captain Underpants overcome his fear of spray starch in time to save the world from the evil schemes of Wedgie Woman? No one knows... except maybe George and Harold, the imaginative fourth-grade troublemakers (imagination is not allowed at Jerome Horwitz Elementary School), who are also the creative minds behind Captain Underpants and Wedgie Woman. You see, it all started (as it usually does) with a comic strip drawn and illustrated by the boys. When their mean teacher Miss Ribble gets her hands on the comic book, their troubles really begin.<p> Fans who have been eagerly awaiting Book 5 in the series, preceded by such gems as <i>Captain Underpants and the Invasion of the Incredibly Naughty Cafeteria Ladies from Outer Space</i> and <i>Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants</i>, will heave a sigh of relief at the appearance of Pilkey's latest tongue-in-cheek superhero adventure novel. Goofier than ever, with plenty of boyish drawings and juvenile humor, this lightweight chapter book is the answer to reluctant (and avid) readers' dreams. If descriptions of Wedgie Woman's bionic hair and the "ubrupt" ending of the "happyness" on the planet of Underpantyworld don't turn grade-schoolers into bookworms, what will? By the way, don't let the quotation from Einstein at the front of the book mislead you; this is lowbrow humor at its very finest.

The pronoun "him" instead of "her," if used often enough, can dissuade a girl from science or math. The words you use determine the density of gray matter in your brain. They affect your political leanings, influ�ence how you see reality, determine your level of confidence and thus, define what it means to be you. That's what words do.</p> <p>As important as your words are in shaping your behavior, they are even more important in the way they shape the behavior of others. Your manner of speaking is, if nothing else, the central factor upon which people form assumptions about you. Whatever is your ultimate goal in life, chances are good you're going to have to communicate your way to it. And if greatness is your goal, well-spoken words are essential. Think about it. From Homer to Hemingway, Lincoln, Churchill, King, Obama-their <i>words </i>are why you know them.</p> <p>The well-spoken few are viewed by others in a different way. They are thought of as more knowledgeable, more informed, and therefore expected to do more things. This law of great expectations is a powerful motivator. We all have an inherent need to meet expectations, whether they be high or low, and when expectations rise, we're inclined to rise with them. Our improvement then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: as others expect us to be better, we become so, and as we become so, they expect it further still.</p> <p><i>How to Speak Like an Academic without Sounding Like One</i></p> <p>The most accomplished speakers use words in ways that complement their thoughts and ideas, not overshadow them. They are able to adopt a scholarly air of authority, but without all those pretentious scholarly words. Take Barack Obama for instance, a man for whom the well-spoken word is a major source of power. President Obama understands, obeys, and exploits the most important command�ment of communication: that it's not so much the words we use, as it is the way we use them. You hear it all the time: "Barack Obama is so articulate, so eloquent, so intelligent." But has he ever used a word any child couldn't comprehend? </p> <p>It's not easy becoming articulate. For most of us, the process is a never-ending exercise in trial and error. We fumble our way along with the occasional foreign word here or big word there, all the while praying we're pronouncing and using these words correctly. And when we do dare to use these words, we risk casting ourselves as pretentious, awkwardly formal, academic, or nerdy. Have you ever used a lofty word and felt embarrassed at having done so? We've all been there. We hear others use these words with ease, but when we try them for size, they don't always fit. That's because we confuse formality with what we believe to be articulate speech. We deploy such language in an attempt to present ourselves as professional when, ironically, usually the opposite effect is achieved. </p> <p> The same can be said for those who attempt to impress with big professorial words. While such language may seem "indubitably" clear and appropriate to them, it strikes the rest of us as more than a bit eccentric. The trick here is to achieve the authoritative and persuasive effects of formality and intellectualism without sounding too, well, formal or intellectual. What you are aiming for is an effect: you want to be regarded as the smartest authority in the room but without the least trace of awkwardness or pretension. And to that end, I present to you this book. Whether it be for writing or speaking, I think you will find it quite helpful. </p> <p> <i>A Few Words About Me</i></p> <p> I began writing what would become this book when I decided, in the spring of 2006, to go back to school and complete my education. It was there in Cambridge that I would come to realize just how inarticulate I really was. And because I could find no easy way to lift my speech and prose quickly, I resolved to invent a way. It began simply enough; whenever I would happen upon an eloquent word or phrase, I would write it down and pair it with what <i>I </i>would have said otherwise. (All those common word entries you see in this thesaurus? That's me talking.) I did this for years, collecting words like butterflies, until it became increasingly apparent that my collection could be of use to others. So you could say that my authority on this subject stems not only from a determination to do something about my own predicament, but to do something about yours. My only hope is that this remarkable collection of words does as much for you in that regard as it has for me.</p></p><h2>Scholastic Success with Reading Comprehension, Grade 3</h2><p>Give students the targeted, skill-building practice they need with these standards-based books!

The practical action steps will help readers grow in character today, even as they set attainable goals for the future.</p><p>Dear Sister in Christ,&nbsp;<br><br>I'm so honored that you are prayerfully considering investing 90 days to explore what it means to be a Proverbs 31 woman today. To be honest, I had always considered it an unattainable goal.&nbsp; Like many women, I was tempted to think the passage was impossible to apply to my life.<br><br>Then I met a widow in Colombia (South America) while serving on the mission field.&nbsp; In the midst of a nation torn apart by decades of civil war and violence, she lived her life with such beauty and excellence that it took my breath away.&nbsp; Her life inspired me and began to open my eyes to the possibilities.&nbsp; Her final words to me were, "Donna, you must tell women everywhere: what God has done for me, he can do for them also."<br><br>I returned home and immediately set to work on that project.&nbsp; Telling women everywhere that, no matter the obstacles, you can become the woman God wants you to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The result of my journey was this book, <b><i>Becoming the Woman God Wants Me To Be: A 90-Day Guide to Living the Proverbs 31 Life</i></b>.&nbsp;<br><br>In many ways, it defies categories. It's unlike most other books on the topic. And that has led to some confusion among readers.&nbsp; In particular, those who were expecting "just" a devotional were surprised by how much practical, down-to-earth advice I've included.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Yes, in once sense it is a devotional - each day includes a scripture to memorize, a passage to read, a scripture-based prayer and space for prayer journaling, and a brief teaching on the day's reading.&nbsp; But it's much more than that.&nbsp; My primary goal was to create a super-practical approach to making this ancient passage 100% relevant to women today.&nbsp;<br><br>Another key to keep in mind is that I've intended this--not simply as a book to read and discuss--but as a handbook covering every conceivable issue and topic presented in Proverbs 31.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not expect -- nor did I intend -- that any woman will immediately implement every idea contained on the nearly 400 pages of the book. My goal was to create a resource that you can return to over and over again, for many years to come, as you enter new seasons in your life and are ready to move closer to God's ideal in any given area.<br><br>I've also created a companion video eclass called <b>The 90-Day Jumpstart</b> which you can learn more about through my online training ministry, Womens Empowerment University.&nbsp; You can find more info about all the courses I offer under the Training tab on my website.&nbsp;<br><br>I've been profoundly touched by the tens of thousands of women around the world who have found help and hope on the pages of <b><i>Becoming the Woman God Wants Me To Be</i></b>.&nbsp; &nbsp;I pray that God will continue to lead each of us forward to become more and more like Jesus, more and more reflective of His original design for our lives.<br><br>Many blessings,&nbsp;<br>Donna Partow<b>Think the goal of becoming a Proverbs 31 woman is out of your reach?

This sturdy board book edition is perfect for little hands!</p><p><em>Kitten's First Full Moon</em> is an acclaimed modern classic, from one of the most celebrated and beloved picture book creators working in the field today. This memorable character and her suspenseful adventure are just right for the very youngest child. It is Kitten's first full moon, and when she sees it she thinks it is a bowl of milk in the sky. And she wants it. Does she get it? Well, no . . . and yes. What a night!</p><p>A concise story, large type, and luminescent pictures play second fiddle to the true star of this book: a brave young kitten who sets out into the world on a quest that leaves her bruised, bewildered, and hungry, but that ultimately leads her back home, where something special is waiting just for her. This perfectly sized board book edition introduces Kitten to a new generation of the youngest readers. Winner of the Caldecott Medal, an ALA Notable Book, a <em>New York Times</em> Best Illustrated Book, and winner of the Charlotte Zolotow Award</p><p>Correlates to the Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts</p></p><p>In this beautiful picture book, winner of the 2005 Caldecott Medal, Kevin Henkes, captures the sweet, sometimes slapstick struggle of Kitten, who sees her first full moon and thinks it's a bowl of milk in the sky.<p> Any child who has yearned for anything will understand how much Kitten wants that elusive bowl of milk. Readers will giggle as she tries to lick the faraway moon and gets a bug on her tongue, or leaps to catch it and falls down the stairs. In an effective refrain, the narrator repeats, "Still, there was the little bowl of milk, just waiting." The winning combination here is the simplicity and humor of the story, paired with gorgeous black-and-white illustrations with thick black lines (mirrored by the thick bold sans-serif font) and shades of grey that are as luminous as a moonlit night should be. Full-moon circles and ovals appear throughout the design: white circle full moons on the endpapers, elliptical flowers by the porch, white circles of firefly light, oval pads on Kitten's paws, and her big round eyes (especially when surprised and soaking wet). Children will love Kitten's quest and ensuing comedy of errors, but what they will love even more is that there's an actual bowl of milk waiting on the porch for Kitten.

An editorial note precedes each work. This deluxe edition is perfect as a keepsake.</p><p>One of the most Gothic short story writers of the nineteenth century, Edgar Allan Poe was a predominant figure of the Romantic movement in American literature and is regarded as the inventor of the detective story. His literary career began with Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827) but it was his deftly plotted short stories which attracted attention. He was also a noticeable literary critic and an unwearying reviewer and essayist. The recurring themes in his works the death of women, bereavement, horror, madness, premature burial, decay, revival of the dead, life after death are suggested to have resulted from his own life, which was a sequence of tragic events and frequent abandonments. Poe skillfully weaved these themes into his meticulous plots and created the macabre world of terror and dark romanticism bringing alive the horror through his choice of words. More than a century and a half after Poe s death, his works still remain as fresh and scary, sending a frightening chill down the spines of his readers.</p><h2>Welding Symbols Quick Card</h2><p><b>Welding Symbols Quick-Card by Builder's Book</b><br> <i>This new, six-page, full-color water resistant card quickly covers essential welding symbols</i> used in architectural plans and engineering drawings.

With concise and sensible definitions, <i>Merriam Webster's Dictionary of Law</i> converts a lease, will, or summons into standard English, and removes the intimidation factor from what is, basically, an effort at reliable communication. Been wondering about tortfeasors and arrears, peculation and naked promises, John Doe summonses and Terry stops? From ABA (American Bar Association) to Zone of Privacy ("an area or aspect of life that is held to be protected from intrusion by a specific constitutional guarantee"), the dictionary defines and explains 10,000 legal terms, allowing a ready grasp of laws, statutes, and legal procedures to anyone who knows how to crack open a dictionary.<p> Despite the title, the book is more than a mere dictionary. There's a chapter explaining the United States judicial system, a chapter discussing important legal cases, and another summarizing important laws. There's also a section on important legal agencies in the U.S., followed by the full Constitution of the United States, making this a useful family legal reference, adding clarity to news reports, assisting with homework assignments, simplifying potentially scary legal actions, and making government agencies, civil rights, and legal options less daunting and more accessible. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>For more than 150 years, in print and now online, Merriam-Webster has been America&#39;s leading and most-trusted provider of language information.

Maxwell provides a concise, accessible leadership book that helps readers become more effective leaders from the inside out. Daily readings highlight twenty-one essential leadership qualities and include Reflecting On It and Bringing It Home sections that help readers integrate and apply each days material.</p><p>Why do some people consistently inspire others to follow their lead? According to John C. Maxwell, author of 24 books and a regular speaker on the topic, it's the "character qualities" they possess. In <i>The 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader</i>, Maxwell identifies these top traits as character, charisma, commitment, communication, competence, courage, discernment, focus, generosity, initiative, listening, passion, positive attitude, problem-solving, relationships, responsibility, security, self-discipline, servanthood, teachability, and vision--and then defines them in ways that readers can absorb and utilize. Each is covered in a separate chapter opening with a high-concept definition and continuing with relevant anecdotes, details on its meaning, suggestions for further reflection, and exercises for improvement. For example, in the section on vision ("You can seize only what you can see"), Maxwell describes how Walt Disney initially developed the theme-park concept after accompanying his daughters to a fun-filled but rather shabby amusement park. He then analyzes how Disney's resultant projects drew on his personal history while meeting other's needs, and explains how readers must "listen to several voices" to develop successful foresight in a similar way. Finally, Maxwell suggests methods to articulate these visions and measure their implementation. <i>--Howard Rothman</i><b>John C.

But if you think you know where you are, guess again. For nothing is ever as it seems in Istvan Banyai's sleek, mysterious landscapes of pictures within pictures, which will tease and delight readers of all ages.<br><b>"This book has the fascinating appeal of such works of visual trickery as the Waldo and Magic Eye books." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews<br><br></i>"Ingenious."-- <i>The Horn Book</i></b></p></p><p>Istvan Banyai is a commercial illustrator and animator as well as the author/illustrator of <i>Zoom</i> (Viking and Puffin) and <i>REM</i> (Viking). He lives in New York City.PreSchool-Grade 3?This wordless picture book re-creates the effect of a camera lens zooming out. For example, one illustration shows a boy on a cruise ship, the next shows him from a distance, and the next reveals the whole ship. Finally, the viewpoint moves back farther and it turns out that the ship is actually a poster on a bus. The perspective continues to recede, revealing the bus as an image on a television screen. Three pages later, viewers see that the person watching TV is drawn on a postage stamp. The final picture shows a view of Earth from space. To heighten the effect, all of the full-color illustrations appear on the recto, while each verso is completely black. It's fun to watch the transition in perceptions as a farm becomes a toy, the girl playing with it is on a magazine cover, etc. The novelty soon wears off, however, and nothing else about the book is memorable. The paintings themselves are not particularly interesting and would not stand alone well.

Along the way, the book hits on marijuana politics, dosage, and pairing strains and flavors, and has tips from MUNCHIES vast network of friends and experts, including "Bong App�tit" stars Ry Prichard and Vanessa Lavorato.</p><p>Launched in 2014, MUNCHIES features groundbreaking content from a youth-driven perspective. Through engaging original video content, compelling editorial features, articles, how-tos, recipes, and events, MUNCHIES offers a signature perspective on the intersection where humans and food connect.INTRODUCTION&nbsp;<br><br> People have been eating weed for thousands of years&#x2014;brewed for tea, crumbled into coffee, as a tincture, mixed with fruits and spice in jam&#x2014;but in the last decade or so, it has started to feel very different. Building on the accumulated wisdom of traditional recipes such as Middle Eastern <i>mahjoun </i>and Indian <i>bhang, </i>cannabis cuisine has gone far beyond brownies and has reclaimed its place as a serious culinary ingredient. We&#x2019;re now living in a new era of marijuana cuisine; one of space-age vaporizers, designer hash, and cutting-edge science, all of which have helped take weed food to a whole other realm.<br><br>In these pages, we&#x2019;re experimenting with weed, but not like teenage stoners hitting a homemade gravity bong. Instead, we have enlisted some incredible chefs to make weed food that eclipses those early brownies&#x2014;the kind of fare that you&#x2019;d want to sit down and eat even if there wasn&#x2019;t weed in it.<br><br>Through a mash-up of modern cooking techniques and hard-won weed wisdom, television series <i>Bong App�tit </i>highlights next-level ingredients and techniques that are revolutionizing the way we use cannabis, as a culinary ingredient&#x2014;leafy green; spice; dried herb; refined, isolated chemical&#x2014;and as something that gets you high.<br><br>Envied for its extensive pantry filled with fine flowers, rare hashes, infused oils, and weed-infused spices, <i>Bong App�tit </i>(the show) redefines luxury in many respects. We realize that many readers, even those who live in states such as California and Colorado where recreational cannabis is legal, won&#x2019;t have access to these products. So we&#x2019;ve translated many ideas from the series into something that works for the home cook. Do you have access to terpenes, cannabinoids, distillates, tinctures, and any strain of bud&nbsp; you desire and are looking for new techniques that will put them on your home table or turn them into professional-level edibles? These recipes will give you plenty to work with. Do you have to text someone shady as hell to get hooked up, so you basically have to work with whatever you can get? There are recipes here for you, too.<br><br>And we&#x2019;re making it easy to know just how high you&#x2019;ll get from a plate of fried chicken wings or a bowl of pappardelle Bolognese. We lab tested all of our recipes to make sure you wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about (a) wasting a bunch of weed making food that doesn&#x2019;t get you high or (b) making food that gets you so high you have to call in sick for work the next day. We&#x2019;ve also asked <i>Bong App�tit </i>hosts Vanessa Lavorato and Ry Prichard to add notes and pro tips throughout the book so you get perspective from seasoned experts.<br><br>And sure, there&#x2019;s some crazy shit in here, like poaching a whole octopus in weed olive oil or force-infusing THC into alcohol with a whipped-cream charger. But we&#x2019;re also keeping it simple enough for the beginner cook to play along, with cannabis getting into most of the recipes via easy-to-make infusions of butter or oil. Still, if you&#x2019;re itching for a challenge, you&#x2019;ll find plenty of next-level options, from cannabis-leaf kimchi to infused pepperoni.<br><br>Some of what you may have seen on the show flies in the face of the conventional wisdom that prioritizes budget over flavor when cooking with weed. We freely admit that burning three ounces of high-quality pot in a smoker or dumping a handful of herb into a fryer was more about experimentation than getting high. You won&#x2019;t find recipes for that kind of thing here. That said, if you feel like balling out, we&#x2019;re not here to stop you. This book is all about giving you the tools and savvy you need to master the art of cooking with cannabis&#x2014;no matter what that looks like for you.<br><br>If you live in a place without legal weed, please know we&#x2019;re sorry&#x2014;and that you are not alone. And, yes, it&#x2019;s incredibly fucked up that there are millions of people in prison for enjoying the kind of recreational activity you&#x2019;re about to read an entire book on, and we&#x2019;re hoping that changes soon too. In any case, rest assured that the recipes in this book can be followed without including any cannabis at all. They&#x2019;re still excellent; they&#x2019;re just not quite as fun.</p><h2>Batman Hush</h2><p><b>Gotham City's worst criminals--Joker, Riddler, Ra's al Ghul, Clayface and others--have emerged to throw Batman's life into utter chaos.

The first is a rich, satisfying, nonhorrific tale about an innocent man who carefully nurtures hope and devises a wily scheme to escape from prison. The second concerns a boy who discards his innocence by enticing an old man to travel with him into a reawakening of long-buried evil. In the third story, a writer looks back on the trek he took with three friends on the brink of adolescence to find another boy's corpse. The trip becomes a character-rich rite of passage from youth to maturity.<p> These first three novellas have been made into well-received movies: "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" into Frank Darabont's 1994 <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> (available as a screenplay, a DVD film, and an audiocassette), "Apt Pupil" into Bryan Singer's 1998 film <i>Apt Pupil</i> (also released in 1998 on audiocassette), and "The Body" into Rob Reiner's <i>Stand by Me</i> (1986).</p><p> The final novella, "Breathing Lessons," is a horror yarn told by a doctor, about a patient whose indomitable spirit keeps her baby alive under extraordinary circumstances. It's the tightest, most polished tale in the collection. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

E. B. Du Bois. It is a seminal work in the history of sociology, and a cornerstone of African-American literary history. To develop this groundbreaking work, Du Bois drew from his own experiences as an African-American in the American society. Outside of its notable relevance in African-American history, The Souls of Black Folk also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works in the field of sociology.</p><p>William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868-1963) is the greatest of African American intellectuals--a sociologist, historian, novelist, and activist whose astounding career spanned the nation's history from Reconstruction to the civil rights movement. Born in Massachusetts and educated at Fisk, Harvard, and the University of Berlin, Du Bois penned his epochal masterpiece, <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, in 1903. It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.<p> With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual "sorrow songs" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in "On Booker T. Washington and Others," where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: "Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races," he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking "withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens." The capstone of <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's "double consciousness," which he described as "a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder." Thanks to W.E.B. Du Bois' commitment and foresight--and the intellectual excellence expressed in this timeless literary gem--black Americans can today look in the mirror and rejoice in their beautiful black, brown, and beige reflections. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line." Thus speaks W.E.B. Du Bois in <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i>, one of the most prophetic and influental works in American literature. In this eloquent collection of essays, first published in 1903, Du Bois dares as no one has before to describe the magnitude of American racism and demand an end to it. He draws on his own life for illustration, from his early experiences teaching in the hills of Tennessee to the death of his infant son and his historic break with the conciliatory position of Booker T. Washington.<p></p><p>Far ahead of its time, <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i> both anticipated and inspired much of the black conciousness and activism of the 1960's and is a classic in the literature of civil rights. The elegance of DuBois's prose and the passion of his message are as crucial today as they were upon the book's first publication.</p></p><h2>I am Jane Goodall (Ordinary People Change the World)</h2><p><b>We can all be heroes.

Outside the windows of O&#x2019;Hare International Airport, the sky was painted a particular shade of gray and leaving droplets of water on the large glass windows that looked out onto the airstrip.<br> <br>Sergio and another boy from New York were at the gate, early for their flight home. Their university escort was sitting, eyes closed, listening to her Discman, waiting for the boys to board so she could go home.<br> <br>What was the other boy&#x2019;s name? Sergio couldn&#x2019;t remember. L-something? Or M-something? For two days Sergio had recognized him as, simply, the white boy with the red hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go see what&#x2019;s in the candy shop.&#x201d;<br> <br>The redheaded boy pointed to the newsstand, which was filled with everything anyone could possibly think of needing before getting onto a plane: newspapers, magazines, headrests, paperback novels, earphones, small suitcases, cold drinks, and lots of candy.<br> <br>Sergio glanced over at the escort, who didn&#x2019;t look up. She didn&#x2019;t even open her eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Sergio said. He took one more glance around to make sure they could find their way back to their gate. Everything in the airport appeared the same, every corner, every window, every set of plastic seats, every gate. It would be easy to get lost. Sergio made sure he would not. Then he checked the information on the board again.<br> <br>Flight 563, JFK.<br> <br>On time, gate 10.<br> <br>His grandmother would be getting up right about now. It was Sunday. Her one day to sleep in. But she was probably up already, making coffee, knowing Sergio would be home in a few hours.<br> <br>Sergio didn&#x2019;t realize how homesick he was, he had been, the whole time, until just then, when he started thinking about his grandmother. It was the first time he had ever been away from home. And he&#x2019;d only agreed to go at all because his grandma was so proud of him.<br> <br>Five kids from New York State had been chosen to be honored at this ceremony at the University of Chicago, all based on one math test they had taken at the end of last year. And for that Sergio had been flown to Chicago, put up in a hotel, and given three meals a day, and when they had called his name&#x2014;his full name, Sergio Kinkaid Williams&#x2014;he had walked across the gigantic stage of the Court Theatre and received his plaque, which was now weighing down his carry-on bag as he perused the newsstand.<br> <br>Kinkaid was his father&#x2019;s last name. Of his father, that was pretty much all he wanted to know.<br> <br>&#x201c;You getting anything to eat?&#x201d; the redheaded boy asked when they got into the checkout line.<br> <br>Sergio slipped his hand into his jeans pocket to feel the twenty-dollar bill his grandmother had given him three days ago. He didn&#x2019;t want to break it if he didn&#x2019;t have to.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t they give us lunch or breakfast or something on the plane?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but they won&#x2019;t give us Kit Kat bars.&#x201d; The boy with the red hair put two candy bars on the counter.<br> <br>Sergio shook his head. &#x201c;Nah, I&#x2019;m good.&#x201d;<br> <br>They finished checking out, and the boy handed Sergio one of the Kit Kats. &#x201c;I hate to eat alone,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Sergio took the candy. He wasn&#x2019;t expecting that. It was nice.<br> <br>The redheaded boy began to unwrap his candy, then stopped. He appeared to be more interested in something across the store. &#x201c;That is so weird, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he said. He pointed. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s she got on her head?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sergio tried to figure out what the boy was talking about, but didn&#x2019;t see anything. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s weird? Who?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Her.&#x201d; The boy gestured across the news shop, to a girl with her back toward them, facing a full wall of magazines.<br> <br>She was wearing regular clothes, jeans and a sweater, but her head was wrapped in a shawl, a thin brown veil. Sergio knew what that meant. She was Muslim. There were a lot of Muslim girls in his neighborhood and in his school, but this kid had probably never seen anyone dressed like that. He was from way upstate New York somewhere.<br> <br>At that moment the girl turned toward them as if she had heard them talking. Her head scarf completely covered her head and neck, all the way down to her shoulders. Like a child&#x2019;s drawing, her pale face was floating in a sea of brown fabric. Her lips pressed together. Her brow furrowed. Her eyes were blue, like the Mediterranean Sea.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, man. Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; Sergio said.<br> <br>It was so not cool to stare.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Naheed was used to it. Being looked at. She was used to people asking if she was wearing a costume. Or saying:<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you were Arab.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you belly dance?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you believe in God?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you really not eat for a month?&#x201d;<br> <br>She wasn&#x2019;t Arab. She was Middle Eastern. Well, she was American, born twelve years ago in Columbus, Ohio, and she had never lived anywhere else. She had never once been to Iran, where her Persian mother and father had grown up. She couldn&#x2019;t belly dance either.<br> <br>But she was used to people staring as soon as she left her house, her neighborhood, her school, her friends, and was out in public, as she was here in O&#x2019;Hare Airport, waiting for her uncle and aunt to arrive.<br> <br>Their flight hadn&#x2019;t come in yet. Naheed&#x2019;s family could have just waited outside for Uncle Iman and Aunt Judith to go through security and baggage, but her dad wanted to be right at the gate when his brother got off the plane, so they had gotten to the airport early. Really early. They had already had snacks, gone to the bathroom, and wandered through all the gift shops, and Uncle Iman&#x2019;s plane was still not here.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you get yourself a magazine?&#x201d; Naheed&#x2019;s father offered. &#x201c;One I would approve of,&#x201d; he quickly added.<br> <br>Naheed gazed at the display wall. There were hundreds of magazines, all with exciting, colorful covers, pretty girls, beautiful clothing, and lots of bare skin. But there wasn&#x2019;t one magazine on this wall her father would let her buy. The girls with their hair blowing freely all around their heads like someone had a fan right in their faces, their bare arms showing even though they were advertising winter fashions; Naheed knew it was immodest.<br> <br>&#x201c;A girl does not need to flaunt her beauty to the world,&#x201d; her mother had told her many times. &#x201c;Real beauty is inside, and the right boy will see that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Naheed decided she didn&#x2019;t need anything after all. She turned to head back to her family. Only now there were people everywhere, filling the news shop, heading in all directions, strolling, rushing, dragging children and bags, but nowhere did she see her mother&#x2019;s or father&#x2019;s or little sister&#x2019;s familiar face.<br> <br>Her father had been standing right there a minute ago.<br> <br>Hadn&#x2019;t he?<br> <br>Naheed looked straight ahead in the direction she had just come from. Or was it that way? Or there? It all looked the same. There were faces everywhere, but no one she knew.<br> <br>Her heart started to pump more quickly, and she felt the heat filling up her body. A tiny band of sweat formed instantly across her forehead. How would she ever find them?<br> <br>She could feel tears springing into the corners of her eyes.<br> <br>There were people all around her. Too many people. Too many faces. She didn&#x2019;t want to start crying, but it was about to happen anyway. She kept walking, looking down at the ground, hoping her feet would keep working even if her brain wasn&#x2019;t. In this way she banged directly into something solid, unmoving, and talking.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, watch where you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d;<br> <br>Naheed looked up. It was so weird&#x2014;for a second it seemed that a girl from one of those magazines had actually stepped out and was here, right in front of her.<br> <br>Light brown hair, long and straight, carefully pulled away from her face and delicate neck. She had perfect skin, and a perfect outfit: white T-shirt with some kind of logo, tucked into her belted jeans.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no, now look what happened,&#x201d; the girl said.<br> <br>The impact of two bodies had sent the girl&#x2019;s bag spilling onto the floor. ChapStick. A water bottle, a Walkman, and a plastic change purse, unfortunately not quite tightly closed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I didn&#x2019;t mean to. . . .&#x201d; Now surely Naheed was going to cry. She began to bend down next to the girl to help her, when she saw, across the way, her little sister, Nouri, waving her arms.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here! Here,&#x201d; Nouri was saying.<br> <br>Naheed felt a wash of comfort pour over her. Her mind cleared. Her heart slowed with relief, then sped back up with joy.<br> <br>She hadn&#x2019;t lost them.<br> <br>There was her family, standing by the far window. The plane had arrived. Even Uncle Iman and Aunt Judith were a welcome sight.<br> <br>Naheed stopped trying to collect the girl&#x2019;s things. She stood up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, never mind,&#x201d; the girl said, wisps of her hair now loose and falling into her eyes as she gathered her things from the floor. &#x201c;I got it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry. I mean thanks,&#x201d; Naheed called back. &#x201c;I mean sorry.&#x201d; But her voice was absorbed into the airport terminal din.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Aimee grabbed for the loose coin that was standing upright and rolling across the floor, but it got away. She didn&#x2019;t feel like chasing it. She let her mind glaze over, watching the nickel or dime or quarter or whatever it was turn like a wheel, to the left, to the right, and left again, before it finally toppled over and a man&#x2019;s thick black shoe stepped right on it, then he went on his way without noticing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aimee, what are you doing on the floor?&#x201d; her mother asked. &#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m in a rush.&#x201d;<br> <br>Aimee knew that. Her mother needed to hurry to catch her flight. Aimee and her dad were going to Los Angeles, but her mom, at the last minute, had to go to New York for a meeting. Her new job meant that &#x201c;last minute&#x201d; happened a lot. It meant nights and sometimes even weekends.<br> <br>And sometimes Aimee just wished her mom&#x2019;s new job had never happened.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have to go?&#x201d; Aimee could hear herself whining, but she couldn&#x2019;t help it. She was starting seventh grade tomorrow in a new school, in a new town, and, to make matters worse, a week later than everyone else because of the bat mitzvah.<br> <br>She might still have been whining about that, except her cousin&#x2019;s bat mitzvah had been so much fun. Aimee&#x2019;s family had already sold their house, so for the weekend of the bat mitzvah they got to stay in the Drake Hotel. Aimee could have stayed down the hall, with her other out-of-town cousins, all girls about her age, but she chose to stay with her parents, like she used to when she was little and they would go away on vacation. If there were two queen-size beds in the room, she would make her parents sleep separately, so that one night she could sleep with one and the next night the other. Her favorite vacation was when they went to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, and there was only one king bed. She slept right in the middle, with her mother and father on either side of her.<br> <br>This time, at the Drake Hotel, they ordered a rollaway brought to the room, but it felt nearly as good. After the bat mitzvah party, when they went back to their room, all the decorative pillows had been taken off the king bed, and the covers were turned down into a perfect triangle. Even her little rollaway had been folded down neatly, set up for her just to climb right in and go to sleep. There were two tiny wrapped chocolates on all of their pillows.<br> <br>Aimee knew she was too old to want to be sleeping in the same room with her parents, but she couldn&#x2019;t help it. She hated it when her mother was about to leave on a business trip.<br> <br>But now as her mother kissed her good-bye and left, Aimee didn&#x2019;t say anything. She didn&#x2019;t want to start crying. She waved as she watched her mother getting farther and farther away.<br> <br>There was still time. She could run after her mother and stop her from leaving. In her mind Aimee played out the scene. She would catch up in a few seconds, before her mother could turn around at the sound of Aimee&#x2019;s sneakers. Aimee would wrap her arms around her mother&#x2019;s waist and hold tight, really tight. They would stay that way for a few moments, hugging, not having to say anything because there would be nothing to say.<br> <br>I love you, Mamaleh.<br> <br>I love you, too, Aimeleh.<br> <br>And then her mother wouldn&#x2019;t get on the plane. She&#x2019;d stay home with Aimee and they would bake cookies.<br> <br>Aimee could still make it.<br> <br>Now.<br> <br>If she ran fast.<br> <br>She even felt the energy tingle in her toes.<br> <br>But she didn&#x2019;t run, and then, poof, the moment was gone, and now there was a stranger, a woman with two little girls hiding behind their mother&#x2019;s legs, talking to Aimee&#x2019;s dad. And there was a boy standing beside the mom, looking embarrassed but protective.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; the mother was saying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; Aimee&#x2019;s father answered.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but do you have the time?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>Aimee&#x2019;s dad looked at his watch and told her the time. At the same time he reached over and gave Aimee a squeeze. He knew she needed it. The woman said, &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; and she and her three kids headed off somewhere in a big hurry. When Aimee looked back down the corridor, her mother was gone.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Maybe it was the way the dad put his arm around the girl when he was looking at his watch. Or maybe it was how the girl kind of looked like Claire, a little bit. They had the same color hair, and Claire wore hers that way too. She was about the same height. But maybe it was just the way the dad was being so attentive to his kid that Will noticed.<br> <br>And he felt a tiny, sharp pain in his throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t need to bother that man,&#x201d; Will said when they had walked past. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the time, Mom. Right up there on the board.&#x201d; He pointed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, I know, but I wanted to double-check,&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;Just to make sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Will and his two sisters, Rooney and Callie, followed their mother through the airport. He wished his mother didn&#x2019;t get so nervous. He really wished she didn&#x2019;t ask strangers for help all the time. And that had nothing to do with his dad dying or the way he got killed. Died or killed, Will wasn&#x2019;t sure, because he still didn&#x2019;t have the right words to explain his father&#x2019;s death. To make sense of any of it. To even think about it.<br> <br>No, his mom had always been like that, talking to anyone, thinking that the universe took care of you, as if all you had to do was ask nicely. She acted as if she really believed people in this world cared about other people and would actually stick their neck out, just because she did that for other people. Because that was the right thing to do.<br> <br>Or because that&#x2019;s how their dad had always done things.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, kids.&#x201d; Will&#x2019;s mother was doing her speed-walking thing through the terminal. &#x201c;We have to hurry.&#x201d;<br> <br>This trip to Florida hadn&#x2019;t been a such a good idea all around. But what could they do? It had been given to them, everything&#x2014;including tickets to Disney World&#x2014;all paid for; a gift of healing from the town of Shanksville. A bunch of his parents&#x2019; friends had decided the family needed to get away on the anniversary, if you could call it that.<br> <br>The whole town, practically, had raised the money, quietly and not so quietly, through bake sales and donations and gifts, and so when they presented the trip to Will&#x2019;s mom, what could she say? No?<br> <br>No, thank you.<br> <br>My family and I don&#x2019;t want to have fun anymore.<br> <br>The lines at Disney World had been so long, the wait sometimes more than an hour, and it had been hot. Callie fell asleep, and their mother ended up ...</p><h2>Mango, Abuela, and Me</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A poignant tale of intergenerational connection, transition, and patience. . . .

The language and vivid illustrations (a colorful<br>blend of ink, gouache, and marker) are infused with warmth and expression, perfectly complementing the<br>story&#x2019;s tone.

Rotten luck. Can&#39;t go! My truck is stuck. Tug and tow. Two engines roar. But the truck won&#39;t go. Not one inch more. Does anyone know how to make my stuck truck go? In this lyrical read-aloud, young drivers are introduced to the ins and outs of hauling, beeping, and repairing -- get ready for a fun ride!</p><p>Kevin Lewis's picture books are known for their boisterous boy appeal and irresistible sounds, which make them perfect for reading aloud. Kevin is the author of <em>Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo </em>and <em>My Truck Is Stuck!</em> He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br><br>Same as above.How many engines does it take to get a pothole-ambushed dump truck unstuck? Readers travel through a stretch of desert road with canines at the wheel before arriving at a shaggy dog of an answer. The pooch driver flags down four vehicles in succession (all driven by various breeds) in hopes of getting a hand (or paw) to "make my stuck truck go." But even with the five vehicles tied together and gunning in unison, the result is a bust: "Lug and lurch. Tug and tow./ 5 engines roar./ The truck won't go." Kirk's illustrations create a subplot: the same culprits (gophers) who dig the hole in which the truck gets stuck also make off with its load (a truckbed full of bones), bit by bit, spread by spread. When Mr. Mechanic shows up with his tow truck, everyone soon heads on their way-though the newly freed truck carries a dramatically lighter load. The formulaic narrative and stark landscape may not have as much of the magical pull as the team's first joint effort, Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo, but this year's model still offers plenty. Lewis gets impressive aural mileage from his simple rhymes, while Kirk soups up his streamlined oil paintings with comic nuance. The dog characterizations are a stitch, and youngsters will enjoy the subtle jokes (a moving van's motto is "Ruff &amp; Reddy," with a red bulldog mascot) along the way. A load of fun. Ages 2-5. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>12 Years a Slave</h2><p>This unforgettable memoir was the basis for the Academy Award-winning film 12 Years a Slave. This is the true story of Solomon Northup, who was born and raised as a freeman in New York. He lived the American dream, with a house and a loving family - a wife and two kids. Then one day he was drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery in the deep south. These are the true accounts of his twelve hard years as a slave - many believe this memoir is even more graphic and disturbing than the film. His extraordinary journey proves the resiliency of hope and the human spirit despite the most grueling and formidable of circumstances.</p><p>This story of the abduction of a free Negro adult from the North and his enslavement in the South--provides a sensational element which cannot be matched in any of the dozens of narratives written by former slaves. &#39;Think of it: For thirty years a man, wit all man&#39;s hopes, fears and aspirations--with a wife and children to call him by the endearing names of husband and father--with a home, humble it may be, but still a home...then for twelve years a thing, a chattel personal, classed with mules and horses....Oh! it is horrible. It chills the blood to think that such are.&#39;Solomon Northup (1808 - c. 1864-1875) was an African American carpenter who was born free in Minerva, Essex County, New York, but was bound into slavery later in life for a period of twelve years. He regained his freedom in January 1853.</p><h2>100 of the Most Beautiful Piano Solos Ever</h2><p>(Piano Solo Songbook). 100 pop and classical standards that every piano player should master, including: Air on the G String * Bridge over Troubled Water * Canon in D * Clair de Lune * Fields of Gold * Fur Elise * I Dreamed a Dream * I Will Always Love You * Imagine * Lullaby of Birdland * Memory * Misty * Moon River * On My Own * Over the Rainbow * The Shadow of Your Smile * Smile * Stardust * Summertime * Sunrise, Sunset * Time After Time * Unexpected Song * The Way You Look Tonight * We&#39;ve Only Just Begun * What a Wonderful World * Yesterday * You Raise Me Up * Your Song * and more!</p><p>Founded in 1947, Hal Leonard LLC has become the worlds largest source of music performance and instructional materials, with a catalog of over a million products in both physical and digital form.

A refugee of the Great War, Poirot is settling in England near Styles Court, the country estate of his wealthy benefactress, the elderly Emily Inglethorp. When Emily is poisoned and the authorities are baffled, Poirot puts his prodigious sleuthing skills to work. Suspects are plentiful, including the victim&#x2019;s much younger husband, her resentful stepsons, her longtime hired companion, a young family friend working as a nurse, and a London specialist on poisons who just happens to be visiting the nearby village. All of them have secrets they are desperate to keep, but none can outwit Poirot as he navigates the ingenious red herrings and plot twists that earned Agatha Christie her well-deserved reputation as the queen of mystery.</p><p>Agatha Christie is the world's best-known mystery writer. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language, and another billion in 44 foreign languages. She is the most widely published author of all time in any language, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare. Her writing career spanned more than half a century, during which she wrote 79 novels and a short story collection, as well as 14 plays, one of which, <i>The Mousetrap</i>, is the longest running play in history. Two of the characters she created, the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and the irrepressible and relentless Miss Marple, went on to become world famous detectives. Both have been widely dramatized in feature films and made-for-TV movies. Agatha Christie died in 1976.<b>Chapter I<br><br> I Go to Styles<br> </b><br> The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as "The Styles Case" has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist.<br><br> I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair.<br><br> I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month's sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though, I had often stayed at Styles, his mother's place in Essex.<br><br> We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me down to Styles to spend my leave there.<br><br> "The mater will be delighted to see you again--after all those years," he added.<br><br> "Your mother keeps well?" I asked.<br><br> "Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?"<br><br> I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who had married John's father when he was a widower with two sons, had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic, autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable fortune of her own.<br><br> Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish early in their married life. He had been completely under his wife's ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their stepmother, however, had always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the time of their father's remarriage that they always thought of her as their own mother.<br><br> Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any marked success.<br><br> John practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home of his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.<br><br> John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother's remarriage and smiled rather ruefully.<br><br> "Rotten little bounder too!" he said savagely. "I can tell you, Hastings, it's making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie--you remember Evie?"<br><br> "No."<br><br> "Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She's the mater's factotum, companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport, old Evie! Not precisely young and beautiful, but as game as they make them."<br><br> "You were going to say--?"<br><br> "Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of Evie's, though she didn't seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an absolute outsider, anyone can see that. He's got a great black beard, and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned to him at once, took him on as secretary--you know how she's always running a hundred societies?"<br><br> I nodded.<br><br> "Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No doubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced that she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she is! It's simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but there you are--she is her own mistress, and she's married him."<br><br> "It must be a difficult situation for you all."<br><br> "Difficult! It's damnable!"<br><br> Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason for existence, perched up in the midst of green Welds and country lanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to the car.<br><br> "Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see," he remarked. "Mainly owing to the mater's activities."<br><br> The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the little station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It was a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat Essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great war was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed into another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:<br><br> "I'm afraid you'll find it very quiet down here, Hastings."<br><br> "My dear fellow, that's just what I want."<br><br> "Oh, it's pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife works regularly 'on the land.' She is up at five every morning to milk, and keeps at it steadily until lunch-time. It's a jolly good life taking it all round--if it weren't for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!" He checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. "I wonder if we've time to pick up Cynthia. No, she'll have started from the hospital by now."<br><br> "Cynthia! That's not your wife?"<br><br> "No, Cynthia is a prot�g�e of my mother's, the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away."<br><br> As he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house. A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed, straightened herself at our approach.<br><br> "Hullo, Evie, here's our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings--Miss Howard."<br><br> Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feet to match--these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation, I soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.<br><br> "Weeds grow like house afire. Can't keep even with 'em. Shall press you in. Better be careful."<br><br> "I'm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful," I responded.<br><br> "Don't say it. Never does. Wish you hadn't later."<br><br> "You're a cynic, Evie," said John, laughing. "Where's tea to-day--inside or out?"<br><br> "Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house."<br><br> "Come on then, you've done enough gardening for to-day. '"The labourer is worthy of his hire,' you know. Come and be refreshed."<br><br> "Well," said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, "I'm inclined to agree with you."<br><br> She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade of a large sycamore.<br><br> A figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to meet us.<br><br> "My wife, Hastings," said John.<br><br> I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall, slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman's that I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed, which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body--all these things are burnt into my memory. I shall never forget them.<br><br> She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted John's invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always stimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents of my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly amused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.<br><br> At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French window near at hand:<br><br> "Then you'll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I'll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there's the Duchess--about the school f�te."<br><br> There was the murmur of a man's voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp's rose in reply:<br><br> "Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful, Alfred dear."<br><br> The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome white-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features, stepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of deference in his manner.<br><br> Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.<br><br> "Why, if it isn't too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after all these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings--my husband."<br><br> I looked with some curiosity at "Alfred darling." He certainly struck a rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore gold rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out of place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He placed a wooden hand in mine and said:<br><br> "This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings." Then, turning to his wife: "Emily dearest, I think that cushion is a little damp."<br><br> She beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every demonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an otherwise sensible woman!<br><br> With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp, however, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place shortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of days or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.<br><br> Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice:<br><br> "Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?"<br><br> "No, before the war I was in Lloyd's."<br><br> "And you will return there after it is over?"<br><br> "Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether."<br><br> Mary Cavendish leant forward.<br><br> "What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just consult your inclination?"<br><br> "Well, that depends."<br><br> "No secret hobby?" she asked. "Tell me--you're drawn to something? Every one is--usually something absurd."<br><br> "You'll laugh at me."<br><br> She smiled.<br><br> "Perhaps."<br><br> "Well, I've always had a secret hankering to be a detective!"<br><br> "The real thing--Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?"<br><br> "Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully drawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous detective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow. He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method. My system is based on his--though of course I have progressed rather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfully clever."<br><br> "Like a good detective story myself," remarked Miss Howard. "Lots of nonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Every one dumfounded. Real crime--you'd know at once."<br><br> "There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes," I argued.<br><br> "Don't mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The family. You couldn't really hoodwink them. They'd know."<br><br> "Then," I said, much amused, "you think that if you were mixed up in a crime, say a murder, you'd be able to spot the murderer right off?"<br><br> "Of course I should. Mightn't be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers. But I'm certain I'd know. I'd feel it in my finger-tips if he came near me."<br><br> "It might be a 'she,' " I suggested.<br><br> "Might. But murder's a violent crime. Associate it more with a man."<br><br> "Not in a case of poisoning." Mrs. Cavendish's clear voice startled me. "Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession, there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected."<br><br> "Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!" cried Mrs. Inglethorp. "It makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there's Cynthia!"<br><br> A young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.<br><br> "Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings--Miss Murdoch."<br><br> Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and vigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty.<br><br> She flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.</p><h2>Mindfulness for Beginners: Reclaiming the Present Moment and Your Life</h2><p><p><b>An Invitation to the Practice of Mindfulness</b></p><p> We may long for wholeness, suggests Jon Kabat-Zinn, but the truth is that it is already here and already ours. The practice of mindfulness holds the possibility of not just a fleeting sense of contentment, but a true embracing of a deeper unity that envelops and permeates our lives. With <i>Mindfulness for Beginners</i> you are invited to learn how to transform your relationship to the way you think, feel, love, work, and play&#x2015;and thereby awaken to and embody more completely who you really are.</p><p> Here, the teacher, scientist, and clinician who first demonstrated the benefits of mindfulness within mainstream Western medicine offers a book that you can use in three unique ways: as a collection of reflections and practices to be opened and explored at random; as an illuminating and engaging start-to-finish read; or as an unfolding "lesson-a-day" primer on mindfulness practice.<br> Beginning and long-time meditators alike will discover in these pages a valuable distillation of the key attitudes and essential practices that Jon Kabat-Zinn has found most useful with his students, including:</p><p> � Why heartfulness is synonymous with true mindfulness<br> � The value of coming back to our bodies and to our senses over and over again<br> � How our thoughts "self-liberate" when touched by awareness<br> � Moving beyond our "story" into direct experience<br> � Stabilizing our attention and presence amidst daily activities<br> � Three fundamental mental factors that cause suffering<br> � How mindfulness heals, even after the fact<br> �Reclaiming our wholeness, and more</p><p> The prescription for living a more mindful life seems simple enough: return your awareness again and again to whatever is going on. But if you&#x2019;ve tried it, you know that here is where all the questions and challenges really begin. <i>Mindfulness for Beginners</i> provides welcome answers, insights, and instruction to help us make that shift, moment by moment, into a more spacious, clear, reliable, and loving connection with ourselves and the world.</p><p><i>Includes a complete CD with five guided mindfulness meditations by Jon Kabat-Zinn, selected from the audio program that inspired this book.</i></p></p><p><p><b>Jon Kabat-Zinn</b><br>Jon Kabat-Zinn, PhD, is the founder and director of the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center and associate professor of medicine in the Division of Preventative and Behavioral Medicine. His clinic was featured in 1993 in the public television series Healing and the Mind with Bill Moyers. Jon Kabat-Zinn is the author of <i>Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life</i> and <i>Full-Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain and Illness</i>.</p>Jon Kabat-Zinn's voice is calm, quiet, and gentle. It fits his discussion of meditation and acceptance though, to be honest, at times it is so calm that listeners may miss key points, or some of the dry jokes he drops subtly into the lecture on the first CD. However, his calm fits the second CD perfectly. On that one his voice allows listeners to relax mind and body and simply follow the guidelines he explains during the five guided meditation exercises. His tone and slow pace allow trust to build with each breath and are evidence of his success in his own stress reduction.

A turn of the page reveals all of the owners of these body parts interacting, alongside several lines of sing-song verse explaining how our noses, hair, etc., are "the same."

Vincent Woodard takes the enslaved person&#x2019;s claims of human consumption seriously, focusing on both the literal starvation of the slave and the tropes of cannibalism on the part of the slaveholder, and further draws attention to the ways in which Blacks experienced their consumption as a fundamentally homoerotic occurrence. The Delectable Negro explores these connections between homoeroticism, cannibalism, and cultures of consumption in the context of American literature and US slave culture. </p><p>Utilizing many staples of African American literature and culture, such as the slave narratives of OlaudahEquiano, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass, as well as other less circulated materials like James L. Smith&#x2019;s slave narrative, runaway slave advertisements, and numerous articles from Black newspapers published in the nineteenth century, Woodard traces the racial assumptions, political aspirations, gender codes, and philosophical frameworks that dictated both European and white American arousal towards Black males and hunger for Black male flesh. Woodard uses these texts to unpack how slaves struggled not only against social consumption, but also against endemic mechanisms of starvation and hunger designed to break them. He concludes with an examination of the controversial chain gang oral sex scene in Toni Morrison&#x2019;s Beloved, suggesting that even at the end of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century, we are still at a loss for language with which to describe Black male hunger within a plantation culture of consumption.</p></p><p><b>Vincent Woodard</b> (1971&#x2013;2008) was Assistant Professor of English at the University of Colorado-Boulder. He received his PhD in English from the University of Texas, Austin in 2002.<br><br><b>Dwight A. McBride</b> is Daniel Hale Williams Professor of African American Studies, English, &amp; Performance Studies at Northwestern University where he also serves as Dean of The Graduate School and Associate Provost for Graduate Education. He is the author of several groundbreaking works in African American Studies, including Impossible Witnesses and Why I Hate Abercrombie and Fitch.<br><br><b>Justin A. Joyce</b> is Postdoctoral Fellow at Northwestern University. He holds a PhD from the University of Illinois at Chicago and is coeditor of A Melvin Dixon Critical Reader."We have all read about the hunger of slaves whose masters sought to starve them into submission. ButThe Delectable Negroasks of these slaves: 'How does it feel to be an edible, consumed object?' Inverting the trope of slave hunger, VincentWoodardprovocatively suggests that the slaveholder is a parasite who feeds off the slaves body in acts that range from cannibalistic to sexual modes of consumption, especially the homoerotic. In an even greater provocation, however, Woodard argues that within the black community, hunger is transformed into a regenerative space from which the search for home and communal belonging may be initiated. A bold and brilliant book." (Carla L. Peterson,author of Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City)<br><br>"The Delectable Negrouncovers a compelling set of themes in the scholarship on U.S. slave culture: white cannibalism as a significant trope for white depletion of, and desire for, the laboring and eroticized black male body. In a stunning series of arguments, Woodard forces us to reconsider the historical out-of-hand rejection of black African fear (and, not rarely, claims) of white cannibalism, showing how remarkably wide-reaching was the sense that slavery satisfied some sadomasochistic instinct among the slave-owning class." (Maurice O. Wallace,author of Constructing the Black Masculine)<br><br>"The Delectable Negro is a brilliant, fearless, and deeply political book." (<i>Early American Literature</i>)<br><br>"With unflinching clarity,The Delectable Negroexposes and examines the pervasive cultural fantasies that have rendered the enslaved black body into a consumable object from the eighteenth century to the present. [] [I]ts powerful insights will continue to generate new lines of important inquiry for years to come." (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"It should be noted here that Woodard died before this book was published; it is a shame that he could not see his daring work enter debate. Praise must go to Joyce and McBride, moreover, for their careful and attentive editorial work that made this publication of this text possible. . . .

Beck, Ph.D., director of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Therapy and Research, a Clinical Associate Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and the daughter of Aaron Beck&#x2014;the founding father of Cognitive Therapy. The Beck name is known throughout the world&#x2014;Dr. Beck&#x2019;s father is known as one of the top 10 most influential psychotherapists in history, on the same list as Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Nationally distributed newspapers and magazines frequently seek out Dr. Beck for her expertise on a range of psychological topics. She is also a frequent guest on national television and radio news broadcasts. </p>Can thinking and eating like a thin person be learned, similar to learning to drive or use a computer? Beck (<i>Cognitive Therapy for Challenging Problems</i>) contends so, based on decades of work with patients who have lost pounds and maintained weight through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Beck's six-week program adapts CBT, a therapeutic system developed by Beck's father, Aaron, in the 1960s, to specific challenges faced by yo-yo dieters, including negative thinking, bargaining, emotional eating, bingeing, and eating out. Beck counsels readers day-by-day, introducing new elements (creating advantage response cards, choosing a diet, enlisting a diet coach, making a weight-loss graph) progressively and offering tools to help readers stay focused (writing exercises, to-do lists, ways to counter negative thoughts). There are no eating plans, calorie counts, recipes or exercises; according to Beck, any healthy diet will work if readers learn to think differently about eating and food. Beck's book is like an extended therapy session with a diet coach. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet the pants settle on each girl's hips perfectly, making her look sexy and long-legged and feel confident as a teenager can feel. "These are magical Pants!" they realize, and so they make a pact to share them equally, to mail them back and forth over the summer from wherever they are. Beautiful, distant Lena is going to Greece to be with her grandparents; strong, athletic Bridget is off to soccer camp in Baja, California; hot-tempered Carmen plans to have her divorced father all to herself in South Carolina; and Tibby the rebel will be left at home to slave for minimum wage at Wallman's.<p> Over the summer the Pants come to represent the support of the sisterhood, but they also lead each girl into bruising and ultimately healing confrontations with love and courage, dying and forgiveness. Lena finds her identity in Greece and the courage not to reject love; Bridget gets in over her head with an older camp coach; Carmen finds her father ensconced with a new fianc�e and family; and Tibby unwillingly takes on a filmmaking apprentice who is dying of leukemia. Each girl's story is distinct and engrossing, told in a brightly contemporary style. Like the Pants, the reader bounces back and forth among the four unfolding adventures, and the melange is spiced with letters and witty quotes. Ann Brashares has here created four captivating characters and seamlessly interwoven their stories for a young adult novel that is fresh and absorbing. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>Carmen got the jeans at a thrift shop. They didn&#39;t look all that great; they were worn, dirty, and speckled with bleach. On the night before she and her friends part for the summer, Carmen decides to toss them. But Tibby says they&#39;re great. She&#39;d &#34;love to have them. Lena and Bridget also think they&#39;re fabulous. Lena decides they should all try them on. Whoever they fit best will get them. Nobody knows why, but the pants fit everyone perfectly. Even Carmen (who never thinks she looks good in anything), thinks she looks good in the pants. Over a few bags of cheese puffs they decide to form a sisterhood, and take the vow of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants . . . the next morning, they say good-bye. And now the journey of the pants-and the most memorable summer of their lives-begins.</p><h2>ESV Economy Bible, Giant Print</h2><p><p>The <em>ESV Economy Bible, Giant Print</em> provides the full ESV text in an extra large font and at an affordable price, making this a great edition for ministry use, outreach, and bulk distribution.</p></p><p></p><h2>You Are Enough: What Women of the Bible Teach You About Your Mission and Worth (English)</h2><p><p><b>An Invitation from God for Belonging and Love</b></p> <p>Every one of us is made in the image and likeness of God.

This book will try to help readers in each of these areas.<br><br>On each page you'll find three sections. The first section will be a quote followed by a few paragraphs on the spiritual message we have found within the quote. We suggest reading the quote and our thoughts on it; then take a few minutes and reflect on your own spiritual journey. How does this quote and our thoughts on the quote speak to your recovery program? Is your program where you want it to be? If so, take pride. If not, think about which of the Twelve Steps you need to work, and what action needs to be taken. We are firm believers that the Steps plus action will solve most problems.<br><br>Next on the page, you'll find a Prayer for the Day. We see prayer as an important action. Prayer is an act of reaching outside of yourself. Prayer is an act of asking for help in the task of being human. We suggest reading the Prayer for the Day, and if it fits for you, repeat it throughout the day. If it doesn't, take a few moments and come up with a personal prayer that fits for you. If none comes to mind, use the prayer suggested in Step Eleven, "Thy will be done." Remember, each day we are to turn our self-will over to our Higher Power. In doing so, we get the serenity the program promises.<br><br>Finally, you'll find a section named Action for the Day. Our illness was fed by a set of actions. Harmful, destructive actions. A recovery program is also about action. Daily spiritual action. Spiritual action helps us feel better about ourselves and safer in the world. In this section, you'll be asked to take action that is, we hope, made to strengthen your program. Again, if the action fits, do it. If not, think of one that fits for you.<br><br>Also in this book, you'll see that we use words like <em>addict </em>and<em> addiction.</em> As time changes, so does language. When we use these terms, we are speaking to both the alcoholic and the drug dependent person. We see no difference between the two. We believe both suffer from the same deadly disease. We ask you to see yourself in the pages, and not in any one word.<br><br>Recovery is a process of finding balance between mind, body, and soul. Hopefully, this book will help you find or strengthen this balance.<br><br>We thank you for letting us share a part of our spiritual journey with you. We wish you well on your spiritual journey. May you and your Higher Power have a wonderful relationship!</p> <p><br><strong>The Authors</strong><strong><br></strong></p> <p>January 1</p> <p><em>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol . . .</em><br><em>&#x2014;From Step One of </em>Alcoholics Anonymous</p> <p>In Step One, we accept our powerlessness over alcohol and other drugs. But we are powerless over many parts of life. We are powerless over other people. We are powerless over what our Higher Power has planned for us.|<br><br>Before recovery, we only believed in control. We tried to control everything. We fought against a basic truth, the truth that we are powerless over much of life.<br>When we accept this truth, we begin to see what power we do have. We have the power to make choices. When we're lonely, we have the power to reach out to others. We have the power to be honest or to lie. We have power over how we live our own lives.</p> <p>Prayer for the Day<br>Higher Power, help me to know that it's You who is running my life. Help me to know that power comes from accepting I am powerless.</p> <p>Action for the Day<br>I am powerless over much of life. Today I'll look to see how this is true. I'll look to see what I really have control over and what I don't.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>January 2<br><em>. . . our lives had become unmanageable.</em><br><em>&#x2014;Second half of Step One</em></p> <p>The First Step tells us a lot about addiction. We were out of control. Our addiction was in control. Addiction managed everything. It managed our relationships. It managed how we behaved with our families. As Step One says, ". . . our lives had become unmanageable."<br><br>But we pretended we managed our lives. What a lie! Addiction ran our lives&#x2014;not us. We weren't honest with ourselves. Our program heals us through self-honesty. We feel better just speaking the truth. We are becoming good people with spiritual values. Our spiritual journey has begun.</p> <p>Prayer for the Day<br>Higher Power, I give You my life to manage. When I'm faced with a choice, I'll ask myself, "What would my Higher Power choose for me?"</p> <p>Action for the Day<br>Today, I'll be honest with a friend about how unmanageable my life had become.<strong><br></strong></p> <p>January 3</p> <p><em>Never play leapfrog with a unicorn.</em><br><em>&#x2014;Unknown</em></p> <p>As we work Step One, we accept that alcohol and other drugs are poison to us. We accept our limits. This means we know that hanging around our drinking or using "buddies" can remind us of "the good old days." Hanging around "slippery places" means we could "slip" back into our old ways. This isn't testing our sobriety; it's being reckless with it.<br><br>So, let's accept our limits. Everybody has limits. When we know our limits, we protect our recovery against the people and places that pull us from our spiritual center. This is what true acceptance means.</p> <p>Prayer for the Day<br>I pray for true acceptance. Higher Power, help me to stay away from slippery places. I will protect the gift You've given me.</p> <p>Action for the Day<br>Today, I'll list the people and places that are risky for me to be around. I will share this list with my sponsor, my group, and my sober friends.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>�2008. All rights reserved. Reprinted from <em>Keep It Simple </em>by Hazelden Meditations.

This fascinating biography charts the musician's extraordinary career and personal life while painting a vivid cultural history of eighteenth-century Europe.

A rhyming text describes a realm in which felines are fed from God's countertop, a place where they no longer get stuck in trees because now they can fly. There are thousands of toys, and soft angel laps in which to cuddle. There is even a quiet time to look back on former homes and loving people. The primitive, childlike painting style is similar to Rylant's work in Dog Heaven (Scholastic, 1995). Both books serve the same purpose of comforting anyone mourning a lost pet, but the writing flows more easily and the pictures are more mature in Cat Heaven. The story has spiritualism and reverence but not in a traditional manner. God is depicted as a kindly older man who washes the cats' bowls and "walks in His garden with a good black book and a kitty asleep on His head." His coloring varies from pink to brown to yellowish tan. The visual impact of the book is stunning. Cats of all colors frolic through the exuberantly hued pages. Vibrant yellows, blues, reds, purples, and greens create a feast for the eyes. Even the color of the text changes to contrast with the background. Whether read as a story to younger children or used in a discussion of the nature of heaven with older ones, this deceptively simple, sweet book is rewarding.?Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>An Absolutely Remarkable Thing: A Novel (The Carls)</h2><p><b><b>THE INSTANT #1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER<i><br><br></i>&#x201c;Sparkling with mystery, humor and the uncanny, this is a&nbsp;fun&nbsp;read.

I am in the wonderful position of having you by the short hairs. I have the story, and so I get to tell it to you the way I want. That means you get to understand me, not just my story, so don&#x2019;t be surprised if there&#x2019;s some drama. I&#x2019;m going to attempt to come at this account honestly, but I&#x2019;ll also admit to a significant pro-me bias. If you get anything out of this, ideally it won&#x2019;t be you being more or less on one side or the other, but simply understanding that I am (or at least was) human.<br><br> And I was very much feeling only human as I dragged my tired ass down 23rd Street at 2:45 a.m. after working a sixteen-hour day at a start-up that (thanks to an aggressively shitty contract I signed) will remain nameless. Going to art school might seem like a terrible financial decision, but really that&#x2019;s only true if you have to take out gobs and gobs of student loans to fund your hoity-toity education. Of course, I had done exactly that. My parents were successful, running a business providing equipment to small and medium-sized dairy farms. Like, the little things you hook up to cows to get the milk out, they sold and distributed them. It was good business, good enough that I wouldn&#x2019;t have had a lot of debt if I&#x2019;d gone to a state school. But I did not do that. I had loans. Lots. So, after jumping from major to major (advertising, fine art, photography, illustration) and finally settling on the mundane (but at least useful) BFA in design, I took the first job that would keep me in New York and out of my old bedroom in my parents&#x2019; house in Northern California.<br><br> And that was a job at a doomed start-up funded by the endless well of rich people who can only dream the most boring dream a rich person can dream: being even more rich. Of course, working at a start-up means that you&#x2019;re part of the &#x201c;family,&#x201d; and so when things go wrong, or when deadlines fly past, or when an investor has a hissy fit, or just <i>because</i>, you don&#x2019;t get out of work until three in the morning. Which, honestly, I hated. I hated it because the company&#x2019;s time- management app was a dumb idea and didn&#x2019;t actually help people, I hated it because I knew I was just doing it for money, and I hated it because they asked the staff to treat it like their whole life rather than like a day job, which meant I didn&#x2019;t have any time to spare to work on personal projects.<br><br> BUT!<br><br> I was actually using my degree doing actual graphic design and getting paid enough to afford rent less than one year out of school. My work environment was close to technically criminal and I paid half of my income to sleep in the living room of a one-bedroom apartment, but I was making it work.<br><br> I fibbed just now. My bed was in the living room, but I mostly slept in the bedroom&#x2014;Maya&#x2019;s room. We weren&#x2019;t living together, we were roommates, and April-from-the-past would want me to be very clear about that. What&#x2019;s the difference between those two things? Well, mostly that we weren&#x2019;t dating before we moved in together. Hooking up with your roommate is convenient, but it is also a little confusing when you lived together through much of college. Before finally hooking up and have now been a couple for more than a year.<br><br> If you happen to already live together, when does the &#x201c;Should we move in together?&#x201d; question come up? Well, for Maya and me, the question was &#x201c;Can we please move that secondhand mattress out of the living room so that we can sit on a couch when we watch Netflix?&#x201d; and thus far my answer had been &#x201c;Absolutely not, we are just roommates who are dating.&#x201d; Which is why our living room still had a bed in it.<br><br> I told you there would be drama.<br><br> Anyway, back to the middle of the night that fateful January evening. This shitty app had to get a new release into the App Store by the next week and I had been waiting for final approvals on some user interface changes, and whatever, you don&#x2019;t care&#x2014;it was boring work BS. Instead of coming in early, I stayed late, which has always been my preference. My brain was sucked entirely dry from trying to interpret cryptic guidance from bosses who couldn&#x2019;t tell a raster from a vector. I checked out of the building (it was a coworking space, not even actual leased offices) and walked the three minutes to the subway station.<br><br> And then my MetroCard got rejected FOR NO REASON. I had another one sitting on my desk at work, and I wasn&#x2019;t precisely sure how much money I had in my checking account, so it seemed like I should walk the three blocks back to the office just to be safe.</p><h2>Music Theory: From Beginner to Expert - The Ultimate Step-By-Step Guide to Understanding and Learning Music Theory Effortlessly (Essential Learning Tools for Musicians)</h2><p><p><b>Unique, Practical and Straightforward Way to Learn Music Theory and Become a Better Musician, Even if You're a Complete Beginner!</b></p><br><p><b>Updated and Massively Expanded Edition with New Exercises, and New Content!</b></p><br><b>This book also features the links to Audio Examples (hosted on external website) so you can hear some music theory concepts in action and understand them better!</b><br><p><b>Have you ever wanted:</b></p><br><ul><li>To know how understanding music theory can make you a better player (on any instrument)?</li><li>To unlock the mysteries of notes, intervals, music scales, modes, keys, circle of fifths, chords and chord progressions, and other important concepts in music, and how they all relate to one another?</li><li>To get a deep understanding of scales, modes and chords, where they come from, what are the different types that exist, how they're built, and how to use <b>any</b> chord or scale in your playing?</li><li>To learn how to form, name and play any chord that is possible to play?</li><li>To learn how rhythm works and how to master your rhythm and timing skills that will make you sound like a pro on any instrument?</li><li>To know the magic behind all the beautiful music that you love and how you can (re)create it by yourself?</li><li>To get a wide perspective on tonal harmony and how melody, harmony, and rhythm work together?</li><li>To understand composition and improvisation, and how to use voice leading and chord inversions to create beautiful harmonies?</li><li>To get a grasp on the advanced concepts (such as modal playing, atonality, polychords and polytonality, free music, etc.) that usually only advanced jazz musicians may consider using?</li></ul><b>But...</b><br><br><ul><li>Have you ever had trouble learning music theory or thought that it wasn't necessary, boring or too hard to learn?</li></ul>If you find yourself in any of this, then this book is what you need.

A lifelong learner, he attacked the problem as an engineer would: examining all the provable facts and scrupulously applying logic. Eventually, his countless hours of research and science proved successful, and he discovered the equation for permanent happiness.<br> <br>Thirteen years later, Mo&#x2019;s algorithm would be put to the ultimate test. After the sudden death of his son, Ali, Mo and his family turned to his equation&#x2014;and it saved them from despair. In dealing with the horrible loss, Mo found his mission: he would pull off the type of &#x201c;moonshot&#x201d; goal that he and his colleagues were always aiming for&#x2014;he would share his equation with the world and help as many people as possible become happier.<br> <br>In <i>Solve for Happy</i> Mo questions some of the most fundamental aspects of our existence, shares the underlying reasons for suffering, and plots out a step-by-step process for achieving lifelong happiness and enduring contentment. He shows us how to view life through a clear lens, teaching us how to dispel the illusions that cloud our thinking; overcome the brain&#x2019;s blind spots; and embrace five ultimate truths.<br> <br>No matter what obstacles we face, what burdens we bear, what trials we&#x2019;ve experienced, we can all be content with our present situation and optimistic about the future.</p><p>Mo Gawdat is the Chief Business Officer at Google&#x2019;s [X]. In the last ten years he has made happiness his primary topic of research, diving deeply into literature and conversing on the topic with thousands of people in more than a hundred countries. He is also a serial entrepreneur who has cofounded more than twenty businesses. He speaks Arabic, English, and German. In 2014, motivated by the tragic loss of his son, Ali, Mo began pouring his findings into his first book, <i>Solve for Happy</i>.Solve for Happy Chapter One<p></p> Setting Up the Equation<p></p> <br>It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re rich or poor, tall or short, male or female, young or old. It doesn&#x2019;t matter where you come from, what you do for a living, what language you speak, or what tragedies you&#x2019;ve endured. Wherever you are, whoever you are, you want to be happy. It&#x2019;s a human desire about as basic as the drive to take the next breath.<br> <br>Happiness is that glorious feeling when everything seems right, when all of life&#x2019;s twists and turns and jagged edges seem to fit together perfectly. In those often all-too-brief flickers of genuine happiness, every thought in your head is agreeable, and you wouldn&#x2019;t mind if time stood still and the present moment extended forever.<br> <br>Whatever we choose to do in life is ultimately an attempt to find this feeling and make it last. Some people look for it in romance, while others seek it in wealth or fame, and still others through some form of accomplishment. Yet we all know of people who are deeply loved, achieve great things, travel the world, snap up all the toys money can buy, indulge in every luxury, and still long for the elusive goal of satisfaction, contentment, and peace&#x2014;also known as happiness.<br> <br>Why should something so basic be so hard to find?<br> <br>The truth is, it isn&#x2019;t. We&#x2019;re just looking for it in the wrong places.<br> <br>We think of it as a destination to reach, when in fact it&#x2019;s where we all began.<br> <br>Have you ever searched for your keys only to realize they were in your pocket all along? Remember how you removed everything from your desk, searched beneath the couch, and got more and more frustrated the longer they went missing? We do the same thing when we struggle to find happiness &#x201c;out there,&#x201d; when, in fact, happiness is right where it&#x2019;s always been: inside us, a basic design feature of our species.<br> Our Default State<p></p> <br>Look at your computer, smartphone, or other gadgets. They all come with preferences preset by the designers and programmers. There&#x2019;s a certain level of screen brightness, say, or a localized user interface language. A device fresh from the factory, set up the way its creators think best, is said to be in its &#x201c;default state.&#x201d;<br> <br>For human beings, simply put, the default state is happiness.<br> <br>If you don&#x2019;t believe me, spend a little time with a human fresh from the factory, an infant or toddler. Obviously, there&#x2019;s a lot of crying and fussing associated with the start-up phase of little humans, but the fact is, as long as their most basic needs are met&#x2014;no immediate hunger, no immediate fear, no scary isolation, no physical pain or enduring sleeplessness&#x2014;they live in the moment, perfectly happy. Even in distressed parts of the world, you can see children with dirty faces using little pebbles as toys or holding a cracked plastic plate as the steering wheel of an imaginary sports car. They may live in a hovel, but as long as they have food and a modicum of safety, you&#x2019;ll see them run around hooting with joy. Even in news coverage of refugee camps, where thousands have been displaced by war or natural disaster, the adults in front of the camera will appear grim, but in the background you&#x2019;ll still hear the sounds of kids laughing as they play soccer with a knot of rags for a ball.<br> <br>But it&#x2019;s not only kids. This default state applies to you too.<br> <br>Look back into your own experience. Summon up a time when nothing annoyed you, nothing worried you, nothing upset you. You were happy, calm, and relaxed. The point is, you didn&#x2019;t need a reason to be happy. You didn&#x2019;t need your team to win the World Cup. You didn&#x2019;t need a big promotion or a hot date or a yacht with a helicopter pad. All you needed was no reason to be unhappy. Which is another way of saying:<br> <br>Happiness is the absence of unhappiness.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s our resting state when nothing clouds the picture or causes interference.<br> <br>Happiness is your default state.<br> <br>When you use a programmed device, you sometimes change its default settings without meaning to, sometimes so much so that certain functions become more difficult to use. You install an app that frequently connects to the Internet, and your battery life decreases. You download malware, and everything starts to go haywire. The same thing happens with the human default for happiness. Parental or societal pressure, belief systems, and unwarranted expectations come along and overwrite some of the original programming. The &#x201c;you&#x201d; who started out happily cooing in your crib, playing with your toes, gets caught up in a flurry of misconceptions and illusions. Happiness becomes a mysterious goal you seek but can&#x2019;t quite grasp, rather than something simply there for you each morning when you open your eyes.<br> <br><br> <br>If we were to picture it, the times when you&#x2019;re unhappy are like being buried under a pile of rocks made up of illusions, social pressures, and false beliefs. To reach happiness, you need to remove those rocks one by one, starting with some of your most fundamental beliefs.<br> <br>As every person who&#x2019;s ever called Tech Support knows, sometimes the first step to bringing a device back to proper functioning is to restore the factory settings. But unlike our gadgets, we humans don&#x2019;t have a reset button. Instead, we have the ability to unlearn and reverse the effects of what went wrong along our path.<br> <br><br> <br>How did we ever get the idea that we have to look for happiness outside us, to strive for it, reach it, achieve it, or even earn it? How did we get things so terribly wrong that we&#x2019;ve accepted that happiness touches our lives only briefly? How did we let go of our birthright to be happy?<br> <br>The answer may surprise you: Perhaps that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve always been trained to do.<br> Solve for Happy<p></p> <br>You may have received sound advice like the kind my mother gave me, that I should study and work hard, save and be willing to defer certain forms of gratification to achieve certain goals. Her advice surely was a major contributor to my success. But I misunderstood. I thought she meant that I needed to defer happiness along the way. Or that happiness would be the result once I had achieved success.<br> <br>Some of the happiest communities in the world are actually in the poorer countries of Latin America, where people do not seem to think much at all about financial security or what we consider success. They work each day to earn what they need. But beyond that, they prioritize their happiness and spend time with their family and friends.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t mean to romanticize a life that appears quaint and colorful but still falls below the poverty line. But we can learn from a mind-set that weaves happiness into each day, regardless of economic conditions.<br> <br>I have nothing against material success. Human advancement has always been driven by innate curiosity, but also by the perfectly reasonable desire to store up enough resources to survive winter or a drought or a bad harvest. Thousands of years ago the more territory your family or tribe controlled and the better your skills at hunting and gathering, the better were your chances of survival. Thus the idea of sitting idle under the mango tree lost ground to the idea of innovating and hustling a bit, expanding one&#x2019;s territory, and building up a surplus, just in case.<br> <br>As civilization developed, more territory and more wealth usually meant better living conditions and the prospect of a longer life. Eventually, capitalism came along, reinforced by the Protestant ethic, which made prosperity a sign of God&#x2019;s favor. Individual effort and individual responsibility allowed the rise of what we now call income inequality, which increased the incentive to work even harder, if only to avoid being outpaced and crowded out by others. And once you&#x2019;d risen, you certainly didn&#x2019;t want to fall back. Because as the competition increased, the traditional supports that had provided security through the family or village eroded.<br> <br>The era just before our own saw the Great Depression and two world wars in quick succession, during which even those at the top of the income ladder had to worry about the basics. As a result, hardship shaped the priorities of an entire generation, underscoring the idea that what mattered most in life was to never endure such hardships again. The &#x201c;insurance policy&#x201d; most widely adopted and passed along was called &#x201c;success.&#x201d;<br> <br>Increasingly, as the twentieth century gave way to the twenty-first, the middle class raised their children to believe that the only logical course was to spend years in educational institutions to gain skills to be deployed in a lifetime of hard work in the hope of attaining security. We learned to make this path our priority, even if it made us unhappy, counting on the promise that when we finally achieved what society defined as success, then, at long last, we&#x2019;d be happy.<br> <br>Now, just ask yourself this question: How often do you actually see that happen? And instead, how often do you see a successful banker or business executive who&#x2019;s swimming in money but seems to be miserable? How often do you hear about cases of suicide of those who seemingly &#x201c;have it all&#x201d;? Why do you think this happens? Because the basic premise is flawed: success, wealth, power, and fame don&#x2019;t lead to happiness. As a matter of fact:<br> <br>Success is not an essential prerequisite to happiness.<br> <br>Ed Diener and Richard Easterlin&#x2019;s work on the correlation of subjective well-being and income suggests that, in the United States, subjective well-being increases proportionately to income&#x2014;but only up to a point. Yes, it feels lousy to have to work two jobs to be able to afford a tiny apartment and a beat-up Honda while paying off student loans. But once your income reaches the average annual income per capita, which in the United States today is about $70,000, subjective well-being plateaus. It&#x2019;s true that earning less can dampen your sense of well-being, but earning more is not necessarily going to make you any happier.1 Which suggests that all the expensive things advertisers say are the keys to happiness&#x2014;a better cell phone, a flashy car, a huge house, a status-worthy wardrobe&#x2014;really aren&#x2019;t so important.<br> <br>Not only are wealth, power, and lots of toys not prerequisites for happiness; if anything, the chain of cause and effect actually works the other way. Andrew Oswald, Eugenio Proto, and Daniel Sgroi from the University of Warwick found that being happy made people roughly 12 percent more productive and, accordingly, more likely to get ahead.2 And so:<br> <br>While success doesn&#x2019;t lead to happiness, happiness does contribute to success.<br> <br>And yet we continue to chase success as our primary goal. One of the earliest psychologists to focus attention on happy individuals and their psychological trajectory was Abraham Maslow. Back in 1933, he summed up our pursuit of success in one profound sentence: &#x201c;The story of the human race is the story of men and women selling themselves short.&#x201d;<br> <br>While a reasonable level of success is common in our society, those who achieve the highest levels of success often have one thing in common, one thing that differentiates them from the pack. They all, almost compulsively, love what they do. Many successful athletes, musicians, and entrepreneurs have achieved their success because they love what they do so much they become experts at it just because the activity itself makes them happy. As Malcolm Gladwell puts it in Outliers, if you spend ten thousand hours doing something, you become one of the best in the world at it.3 And what&#x2019;s the easiest way to spend so many hours on one thing? Doing something that makes you happy! Wouldn&#x2019;t that be better than spending a lifetime trying to reach success in hopes that it will eventually lead to happiness? At work, in our personal life, relationships or love life, whatever it is that we do, we should directly:<br> <br>Solve for Happy.<br> What Is Happiness?<p></p> <br>At my lowest point, back in 2001, I realized that I would never restore the happiness that was my birthright if I didn&#x2019;t at least know what I was looking for.<br> <br>So, being an engineer, I set out to develop a simple process to collect the data I needed to determine what made me happy. First, though, I hesitated because the technique was so simple it seemed almost childish. But then it occurred to me: if our model for the default condition of human happiness is the infant or toddler, maybe &#x201c;childish,&#x201d; or at least &#x201c;childlike,&#x201d; is not such a bad thing.<br> <br>I started by simply documenting every instance when I felt happy. I called it my Happy List. You might want to do the same thing. In fact, why not take a moment right now, pull out a pencil and a piece of paper, and jot down some of the things that make you happy. As assignments go, this one&#x2019;s not too tough. The list can be nothing more than a string of short, declarative sentences that get right to the point and complete the phrase<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel happy when ______________.&#x201d;<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t be shy. There&#x2019;s no reason to feel inhibited because no one ever has to see your list. You can include the obvious stuff, like scratching your dog under her chin or watching a beautiful sunset, and simple things like talking to your friends or eating scrambled eggs. There are no wrong answers. Write as many as you can think of.<br> <br>When you&#x2019;re done, at least for the first pass, go back and highlight a few items that, if you were forced to set priorities, would be at the top of the list of things that make you happiest. Those will make for a valuable short list that will prove useful in our later discussions.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s some good news already: the very act of creating your Happy List makes for a very happy experience, so much so that, when you&#x2019;re finished, you should feel energetic and refreshed. I work on my list at least once a week, adding new things. Not only does it put a smile on my face, but it helps me cultivate something that psychologists say contributes to happiness over the long haul: an attitude of gratitude, which happens when you acknowledge the truth about our modern lives and the fact that there is plenty to be happy about after all.<br> <br><br> <br>So go ahead and enjoy. I&#x2019;ll go make a cup of coffee and wait for you. (By the way, I feel happy when I enjoy a quiet cup of coffee!)<br> The Happiness Equation<p></p> <br>My hunch is that your list consisted almost entirely of ordinary moments in life&#x2014;a smile on your child&#x2019;s face, the smell of warm coffee first thing in the morning, the kinds of things that happen every day.<br> <br>So what&#x2019;s the problem? If the triggers for happy moments are so ordinary and so accessible, why does &#x201c;finding&#x201d; happiness remain such a big challenge for so many people? And why, when we &#x201c;find&#x201d; it, does it so easily slip away?<br> <br>When engineers are presented with a set of raw data, the first thing we do is to plot it and attempt to find a trend line. So let&#x2019;s apply this to your Happy List and find the common pattern among the different instances of happiness on it. Can you see the trend?<br> <br>The moments that make you h...</p><h2>My First Hands-On Bible</h2><p><i>My First Hands-On Bible</i> is the preschooler version of the popular <i>Hands-On Bible</i>, which has sold over a half million copies.

Little ones will bounce with anticipation as the simple yet clever text takes them to visit one sheep and then another. The green sheep, however, is nowhere to be seen until the final spread, where he is found under a very green bush, fast asleep. Until the lost sheep turns up, children will have fun with the other sheep that make an appearance and perhaps, unbeknownst to them, also get lessons in colors and comparisons (the <i>near</i> sheep, the <i>far</i> sheep). In this neat and satisfying wedding of text and art, the squat, square format uses wool-white backgrounds to display much of the amusing pen-and-watercolor pictures. As for the sheep themselves, Horacek has concocted simply lined happy animals, whose wool is indicated by dozens of curlicues. Laughs and interactive play will ensue among readers and listeners, alone or in groups. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Windy can tell such stories herself&#x2013;about her dog, Itchy Boy, and the way he dances to request a treat and how he wriggles with joy in response to, well, just about everything. <br> <br>When Uncle and Windy Girl and Itchy Boy attend a powwow, Windy watches the dancers in their jingle dresses and listens to the singers. She eats tasty food and joins family and friends around the campfire. Later, Windy falls asleep under the stars. Now Uncle's stories inspire other visions in her head: a bowwow powwow, where all the dancers are dogs. In these magical scenes, Windy sees veterans in a Grand Entry, and a visiting drum group, and traditional dancers, grass dancers, and jingle-dress dancers&#x2013;all with telltale ears and paws and tails. All celebrating in song and dance. All attesting to the wonder of the powwow. <br> <br>This playful story by Brenda Child is accompanied by a companion retelling in Ojibwe by Gordon Jourdain and brought to life by Jonathan Thunder's vibrant dreamscapes.

But the lessons he draws from shadowing elite athletes and from traveling to high-tech labs around the world are surprisingly universal.

What exactly is going on there?</b></b><br><br>Is Area 51 a top secret military base that lies in the middle of the barren Nevada desert? Or could it actually be a facility for examining aliens and their spaceships? People can't drive anywhere close to it; the US government rarely acknowledges its existence; and until recently, the airspace overhead was restricted! Conspiracy theories abound about what goes on at Area 51, especially since 1947 when strange objects were found in the middle of a field in Roswell, New Mexico. Author Paula K. Manzanero explains why Area 51 was established and reveals the mystery behind those unidentified flying objects in the sky. Check out this book and decide what you believe.</p><p>Paula K. Manzanero is an Executive Editor at Penguin Workshop and a children's book author.<br><br>Tim Foley is a freelance illustrator who currently lives and works in Grand Rapids, Michigan.<b>Where Is Area 51?</b><br><br> &nbsp;<br> On June 14, 1947, a ranch worker named William Brazel found a pile of strange items smack in the middle of an open field near Roswell, New Mexico. It included some wood, foil, and rubber. Where had these things come from? They weren&#x2019;t things that belonged out on the ranch. When Brazel went to town on July 7, he told the local sheriff about what he&#x2019;d found, who immediately reported the findings to the US Army Air Force base nearby in Alamogordo. The sheriff thought all of these things probably had come from the army airfield, which was just down the road.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Right away, US government scientists arrived to investigate. They said that the found objects had been pieces of a crashed weather balloon. The Army Air Force had been testing large weather balloons in the area during a powerful storm earlier in the week.<br> &nbsp;<br> This made sense, but some people were suspicious. Men from the base had arrived so quickly and cleaned the site so well. Were they trying to hide something? If so, what could it be?&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On July 8, the <i>Roswell Daily Record</i> printed a startling headline that said &#x201c;RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region.&#x201d; (The RAAF was the Roswell Army Air Field.) And the headline, although later corrected, fueled one of the greatest mysteries in US history.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why would the newspaper print a story that wasn&#x2019;t true? The residents of Roswell began to wonder. Some people&#x2014;including many who lived nowhere near the town&#x2014;began telling stories of metal beams and strange objects that had been recovered at Roswell. They believed the first newspaper story was true. They said that the army had removed all evidence of a flying saucer and its alien passengers.<br> &nbsp;<br> As years passed, many of these people came to believe the &#x201c;evidence&#x201d; had been taken to a secret government site deep in the Nevada desert. The site was two states and nearly nine hundred miles away, on the edge of Groom Lake. It was referred to simply by its location on the map: Area 51, one of the most secretive, off-limits places on the planet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Just a Space on the Map</b><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Area 51 is located in the southern corner of Nevada, in the harsh Mojave Desert of the western United States. There were originally iron and silver mines and small mining communities dotting the flat, dry landscape that includes mesas, salt flats, and dry lake beds of hardened clay.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1942, there were only two dirt runways on the property near Groom Lake. The area was used by the US Army for bomb practice. The number fifty-one in Area 51 is believed to refer to the parcel of land as named on the surveyor&#x2019;s map created in the early 1950s.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was in these types of lonely desert areas of the American southwest that bombing tests could be conducted&#x2014;including tests of the nuclear weapons used in World War II. The types of nuclear weapons that were being tested were explosive devices that released huge amounts of destructive energy. These included the hydrogen bomb and the atomic bomb.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The US bases that developed these weapons&nbsp;included Los Alamos and Alamogordo, both in the state of New Mexico.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Because even a small nuclear bomb can devastate an entire city, wide-open and unpopulated spaces were the safest places to test them. The US government also felt that the desert provided enough privacy for these top secret projects.<br> &nbsp;<br> Area 51 sits just outside America&#x2019;s only atomic bomb range, which was called the Nevada Test Site. From 1951 to 1992, nuclear weapons were exploded aboveground and underground in tunnels and specially drilled shafts.<br> &nbsp;<br> At first, the site was called &#x201c;Paradise Ranch&#x201d; to attract employees. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) conducted background checks on anyone wanting to work there.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> CIA agents asked each job applicant&#x2019;s friends and neighbors if they thought the person might be a foreign spy. The CIA wanted to be absolutely certain that everyone working at the site could be trusted.<br> &nbsp;<br> The land around the Nevada Test Site belonged to the Atomic Energy Commission. The US government has always referred to it simply&#x2014;and mysteriously&#x2014;as an &#x201c;operating site,&#x201d; never acknowledging the existence of Area 51 until as late as 1998!<br> &nbsp;<br> Originally only six miles wide and ten miles long, Area 51 came to encompass over four hundred square miles of restricted land and airspace. (<i>Restricted</i> means that the area is very tightly controlled.) A large military airfield sits at its center, on the southern edge of Groom Lake. This dry lake bed, about three miles across, has become a US government landing strip for experimental aircraft. These are new types of planes that are developed with the very latest technologies.</p><h2>The Berenstain Bears and Too Much Vacation</h2><p><b>This classic Berenstain Bears story is a perfect way to teach children about making the best out of a bad situation!&nbsp;</b><br><br>Go on a vacation with the Bear family in this classic First Time Book� from Stan and Jan Berenstain.

In this brilliant, timely, and practical work, Chopra and Kafatos tell us that we've reached just such a point. In the coming era, the universe will be completely redefined as a "human universe" radically unlike the cold, empty void where human life is barely a speck in the cosmos.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>You Are the Universe</i>&nbsp;literally means what it says--each of us is a co-creator of reality extending to the vastest reaches of time and space. This seemingly impossible proposition follows from the current state of science, where outside the public eye, some key mysteries cannot be solved, even though they are the very issues that define reality itself:<br> &nbsp;<br>� What Came Before the Big Bang?<br>� Why Does the Universe Fit Together So Perfectly?<br>� Where Did Time Come From?<br>� What Is the Universe Made Of?<br>� Is the Quantum World Linked to Everyday Life?<br>� Do We Live in a Conscious Universe?<br>� How Did Life First Begin?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The shift into a new paradigm is happening,&#x201d; the authors write. &#x201c;The answers offered in this book are not our invention or eccentric flights of fancy. All of us live in a participatory universe. Once you decide that you want to participate fully with mind, body, and soul, the paradigm shift becomes personal. The reality you inhabit will be yours either to embrace or to change.&#x201d; What these two great minds offer is a bold, new understanding of who we are and how we can transform the world for the better while reaching our greatest potential.</p><p><b>Deepak Chopra, MD, FACP,</b>&nbsp;founder of The Chopra Foundation and co-founder of the Chopra Center for Wellbeing and Jiyo, is a world-renowned pioneer in integrative medicine and personal transformation, and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism.&nbsp;He is a Fellow of the American College of Physicians, Clinical Professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health at the University of California, San Diego, Researcher, Neurology and Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and a member of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.&nbsp;<i>The World Post</i> and <i>The Huffington Post</i> global internet survey ranked Chopra #17 influential thinker in the world and #1 in Medicine.&nbsp;Chopra is the author of more than 85 books translated into over 43 languages, including numerous New York Times bestsellers.

Brilliant equations are devised to keep reality intact, so the very fact that the mathematics was so arcane kept some very disturbing ideas away from the general public. But this all changed with the advent of the big bang theory. In one stroke, time snapped in two. There was time as we know it, which arrived on the scene with the big bang, and there was something else&#x2014;�weird time, pre-�time, no time?&#x2014;�that existed outside our universe.<br><br>Following Einstein&#x2019;s lead, let&#x2019;s see if we can visualize reality outside our universe. For the sake of convenience, we&#x2019;ll put the riddle this way: &#x201c;What came before the big bang?&#x201d; There&#x2019;s no better way to visualize the problem than stepping into an imaginary time machine that&#x2019;s whisking us back some 13.7 billion years. As we get close to the unimaginable explosion that began this universe&#x2019;s creation, our time machine is exposed to extreme danger. It took thousands of years for the infant universe, which was superheated, to cool down enough for the first atoms to coalesce. But since our time machine is imaginary to begin with, we can imagine it coasting through superheated space without melting or flying apart into subatomic particles.<br><br>Getting within a few seconds of the big bang, we feel we&#x2019;re nearing the goal. &#x201c;Seconds&#x201d; means that time exists, and now the only challenge is to shave seconds down to millionths, billionths, and trillionths of a second. The human brain doesn&#x2019;t operate at such fine scales, but let&#x2019;s assume we have an onboard computer that can translate trillionths of a second into human terms. Eventually we arrive at the smallest unit of time (and space) that it is possible to imagine. William Blake&#x2019;s famous lines of verse, &#x201c;Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour,&#x201d; is coming true, although an hour is much, much too long. At this point, when the scale of the cosmos was infinitesimally tiny, our onboard computer goes haywire and unexpectedly, nothing can compute.<br><br>Our whole frame of reference has dissolved. There is no matter or energy, just a swirling chaos, and within this chaos there are no rules of the kind we call the laws of nature. Without rules, time itself falls apart. The captain of our time machine turns to the passengers to tell them how bad the situation is, but unfortunately, he can&#x2019;t, for several reasons. As time collapses, so do concepts like &#x201c;before&#x201d; and &#x201c;after.&#x201d; To the captain, we no longer left earth at a certain time and arrived later at the big bang. Events are all gummed together in an unimaginable way. The passengers can&#x2019;t cry, &#x201c;Let me out of here,&#x201d; either, because space has also dissolved, rendering &#x201c;in&#x201d; and &#x201c;out&#x201d; useless concepts.<br><br>This breakdown at the very threshold of creation is real, even if our time machine isn&#x2019;t. No matter how hard you work at it, regardless of how fine the slivers of time you shave, the threshold cannot be crossed&#x2014;�not by ordinary means, because, you see, the big bang &#x201c;occurred everywhere,&#x201d; so it was not somewhere to where we could travel.<br><br>We are left with two options. Either &#x201c;What came before the big bang?&#x201d; is an impossible question to answer, or else extraordinary means must be discovered that could possibly reveal an answer. One thing is certain, however: the origin of time and space didn&#x2019;t happen in time and space. It happened somewhere extraordinary, which, luckily for us, means that extraordinary answers aren&#x2019;t out of place&#x2014;�they are demanded. With that in mind, let the cosmic riddling begin.<br><br>Grasping the mystery<br><br>&#x201c;Before&#x201d; and &#x201c;after&#x201d; are concepts that make sense only within the framework of space-�time. You were born before you could walk; you will reach old age after middle age. The same isn&#x2019;t true of the birth of the universe. It has been widely theorized that time and space emerged with the big bang. If that&#x2019;s true&#x2014;�and it&#x2019;s only one possibility, not a fixed assumption&#x2014;�then the real question is &#x201c;What came before time began?&#x201d; Is that any better than the first way of putting it?<br><br>No. &#x201c;Before time began&#x201d; is a self-�contradiction, like saying &#x201c;when sugar wasn&#x2019;t sweet.&#x201d; We are squarely in the realm of impossible questions, but that&#x2019;s no reason to give up in advance. Quantum physics took to heart a conversation between Alice and the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s Through the Looking-�Glass. After Alice announces that she is seven and a half years old, the Queen retorts that she is a hundred and one, five months, and a day.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe that!&#x201d; said Alice.<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; the Queen said in a pitying tone. &#x201c;Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>Alice laughed. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no use trying,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;One can&#x2019;t believe impossible things.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I dare say you haven&#x2019;t had much practice,&#x201d; said the Queen. &#x201c;When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I&#x2019;ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.&#x201d;<br><br>Quantum behavior forces us to be even more tolerant of impossible things. There is nothing ordinary about the conditions at the time of the big bang. To grasp them, some cherished beliefs must be challenged and then cast aside. First, one must realize that the big bang wasn&#x2019;t the beginning of the universe but of the current universe. Ignoring for now whether the current universe was created from another universe, physics can&#x2019;t actually trace the cosmos back to the absolute beginning. Taking measurements only works when you have something to measure, and in the very beginning there was an infinitesimal sliver of something, without order of any kind: no objects, no space-�time continuum, no laws of nature. In other words, pure chaos. In this unimaginable state, all the matter and energy harnessed in hundreds of billions of galaxies was compressed. Within a fraction of a second, expansion accelerated with inconceivable speed. Inflation lasted between 10-�36 (1/1 followed by 36 zeros) to about 10-�32 seconds. By the time inflation ended, the universe had increased its size by a staggering factor of 1026, while it cooled down by a factor of 100,000 times or so. A commonly accepted (but by no means definitive) scenario maps the birthing process as follows:<br><br>�10-�43 seconds&#x2014;�The big bang.<br><br>�10-�36 seconds&#x2014;�The universe undergoes a rapid expansion (known as cosmic inflation), under superheated conditions, enlarging from the size of an atom to the size of a grapefruit. There are no atoms in existence, however, or any light. In a state of near chaos, the constants and the laws of nature are thought to be in flux.<br><br>�10-�32 seconds&#x2014;�Still unimaginably hot, the universe boils with electrons, quarks, and other particles. The previous rapid inflation decreases, or takes a pause, for reasons not fully understood.<br><br>�10-�6 seconds&#x2014;�Having cooled dramatically, the infant universe now gives rise to protons and neutrons that are formed from groups of quarks.<br><br>�3 minutes&#x2014;�Charged particles exist but no atoms yet, and light cannot escape the dark fog that the universe has become.<br><br>�300,000 years&#x2014;�The cooling process has reached a state where atoms of hydrogen and helium begin to form out of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Light can now escape, and how far it travels will determine from this point onward the outer edge (the event horizon) of the visible universe.<br><br>�1 billion years&#x2014;�Through the attraction of gravity, hydrogen and helium coalesce into clouds that will give rise to stars and galaxies.<br><br>This time line follows the momentum produced by the big bang, which was sufficient, even when the universe was the size of a single atom, to produce the billions of galaxies visible today. They continue to be driven apart by the force of the initial unimaginable expansion. Many complex events have occurred since the beginning (whole books are devoted to describing just the first three minutes of creation), but for our purposes, it&#x2019;s enough to view the rough outline.<br><br>Because we can all envision how a stick of dynamite or a volcano explodes, the big bang seems to fit our commonsense view of reality. But our grasp of what happened is fragile. In fact, the first seconds of creation call into question almost everything we perceive about time, space, matter, and energy. The great mystery about the emergence of our universe is how something was created out of nothing, and no one can truly comprehend how this occurred. On the one hand, &#x201c;the nothing&#x201d; is unreachable by any form of observation. On the other hand, the initial chaos of the infant universe is a totally alien state, being devoid of atoms, light, and perhaps even the four basic forces of nature.<br><br>This whole mystery can&#x2019;t be avoided, because the same birthing process continues, right this minute and all the time, at the subatomic level. Genesis is now. The subatomic particles that the cosmos is built upon wink in and out of existence continually. Like a cosmic on/off switch, there is a mechanism that turns nothing (the so-�called vacuum state) into a teeming ocean of physical objects. Our commonsense view of reality sees the stars floating in a cold, empty void. In actuality, however, the void is rich with creative possibilities, which we see playing out all around us.<br><br>Already the argument feels like it&#x2019;s getting abstract, ready to float away like a helium balloon. We don&#x2019;t want that to happen. Every cosmic mystery has a human face. Imagine that you are sitting outside in a lawn chair on a summer day. A warm breeze makes you drowsy, and your mind is filled with half-�seen images and half-�realized thoughts. Suddenly someone asks, &#x201c;What do you want for dinner?&#x201d; You open your eyes and answer, �&#x201c;Lasagna.&#x201d; In this little scenario the mystery of the big bang is encapsulated. Your mind is capable of being empty, a blank. Chaotic images and thoughts roam across it. But when you are asked a question and make a reply, this emptiness comes to life. Out of infinite possibilities, you pick a single thought, and it forms in your mind of its own accord.<br><br>This last part is crucial. When you say &#x201c;lasagna&#x201d;&#x2014;�or any other word&#x2014;�you don&#x2019;t build it up from something smaller. You don&#x2019;t construct it at all; it just comes to you. For example, words can be broken down into letters, the way matter can be broken down into atoms. But of course, this isn&#x2019;t a true description of the creative process. All creation brings something out of nothing. It&#x2019;s humbling to realize that even as we feel comfortable being creators, immersed in infinite words and thoughts, we have no idea where they come from. Do you know your next thought? Even Einstein looked upon his most brilliant thoughts as happy accidents. The point is that creating something out of nothing is a human process, not a faraway cosmic event.<br><br>The transition of nothing into something always achieves the same result: a possibility becomes actual. Physics dehumanizes the process and does so with incredible precision. In unimaginably small scales of time, vibrations of quanta come out of emptiness and quickly merge back into emptiness, but this quantum on/off cycle is totally invisible to us. The rules governing physical creation must be deduced. You can&#x2019;t apply a stethoscope to the outside of the Superdome in order to discover the rules of football, and that&#x2019;s essentially what cosmology is doing, in attempting to explain the origin of the universe. Logical deduction is a great tool, but this may be a case in which it creates as many problems as it solves.<br><br>A baffling beginning<br><br>There&#x2019;s little doubt that the objects in space didn&#x2019;t exist before the big bang. But did space and time (technically, the space-�time continuum) also emerge with them? The standard reply is yes. If there were once no objects, there was no space or time, either. So what was the pre-�created state like? It didn&#x2019;t have an inside or outside, which are properties of space. As the infant universe expanded, it wasn&#x2019;t expanding with anything around it, and now, while billions of galaxies operate in outer space, the universe isn&#x2019;t like a balloon with a skin. Here again, the concepts of before and after, inside and outside simply don&#x2019;t apply.<br><br>Are we left with anything to hold on to? Barely. &#x201c;To exist&#x201d; suggests the possibility that even without time and space, things might happen. Here&#x2019;s a useful analogy. Imagine that you are sitting in a room where you notice that objects are moving slightly: the milk in your cereal bowl is jiggling, and you can feel a vibration coming up through the floor.<br><br>As it happens, you are deaf, so you have no way of knowing if something is pounding on the walls of the room from the outside. (Some people might be sensitive enough to feel a vibration in their bodies&#x2014;�let&#x2019;s leave this aside.) But you can measure the waves in your cereal bowl and the vibrations of other objects, including the floor, ceiling, and walls. This is roughly how cosmologists confront the big bang. The universe is full of vibrations and waves emitted billions of years ago. These can be measured and inferences drawn from them. But uneasiness appears if we ask a simple question: Can someone who is deaf from birth actually know what sound is? Though there are measurable vibrations associated with sound, feeling them is not the same experience as hearing a solo violin, the voice of Ella Fitzgerald, or a dynamite explosion.<br><br>In the same way, measuring the light from racing galaxies and the background microwave radiation in the current universe (this radiation is a residue of the big bang) doesn&#x2019;t tell us what the beginning of the universe was like&#x2014;�we are working from inferences, just like a deaf person observing waves in his cereal bowl, and this limitation could be a fatal flaw in any explanation of where the universe came from.<br><br>We can still try, from our standpoint here in our space-�time, to explore laws of nature that operate outside space and time. In particular, physics can resort to the language of mathematics in the hopes that its existence doesn&#x2019;t depend on which universe you happen to live in. Most of the speculation that follows keeps faith with mathematics as something eternally valid. Even in an alien universe, where time goes backward and people walk on the ceiling, if you add one apple to another apple, the sum is two apples, right?<br><br>However, no one has ever proved that this faith is actually valid. The mathematics that&#x2019;s applicable to black holes, for example, is locked in speculation, because a black hole is totally impenetrable. Mathematics could be the product of the human brain. Take the number zero. It hasn&#x2019;t always been around. By 1747 BCE, the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians had a written symbol for zero as a concept, but it wasn&#x2019;t used as a number for calculating purposes until around AD 800, in India, long past the heyday of Greek and Roman culture.</p><h2>Poetry Speaks Who I Am: 100 Poems of Discovery, Inspiration, Independence, and Everything Else for Teens (A Poetry Speaks Experience, Includes CD)</h2><p><p><em>Poetry Speaks Who I Am</em> is filled with more than 100 remarkable poems about you, who you are, and who you are becoming.

It's made just for you.</p> <p>When I was younger, I wish I had possessed an anthology like this one-a compilation that brings poetry to life through words and recordings. In grammar school, I memorized the poems I discovered in a favorite poetry anthology my parents had given me. In high school, after my British Literature teacher introduced me to the work of William Butler Yeats, I began to understand how to write a poem. But in middle school there were no poetry anthologies compiled just for students and poetry was not taught in class. So I gravitated toward poets of the past and read William Shakespeare's love sonnets, trying to imitate them. I had no idea that poets were alive and writing. This anthology attempts to fill that void by offering poems about subjects that might express what's on your mind.</p> <p>Youth inspires poets. So when we asked poets to send poems either that were important to them at your age or that they'd written about <em>being </em>your age, we received hundreds of submissions. Many writers try to capture those moments you may be thinking about now as you step into a new world.</p> <p>We strived to create an anthology where you can discover poems about the changes taking place in your life. We offer first kiss poems like "Zodiac" or "The Skokie Theatre." If you've ever stood in the outfield, waiting to catch a fly ball, check out "Baseball." There are some Bar Mitzvah poems called "33" and "49." Poems about changing bodies such as "Bra Shopping." Poems about the times you think you hate your mother as in "The Adversary" and poems about loving her such as "Dear Mama (4)." Poems about loneliness like Robert Frost's "Acquainted with the Night." We even have a "Vampire Serenade." There are poems about navigating the turbulence of friendship like "Caroline" or the riptides of your parents' marriage as in "Mediation." We have paired classic poems with contemporary poems, from John Keats to Toi Derricotte, so you can read how poets throughout the ages have mulled over the same subjects.</p> <p>Some poems will help you catch your breath, others will let you slowly exhale. Many of the poets traveled to studios to record their poems for <em>Poetry Speaks Who I Am</em>. When you listen to the CD, you will hear the immediacy of their words and the nuance of expression, and you will be able to hear and perhaps understand the poem from the poet's perspective.</p> <p>In seventh grade, my friends and I would get together at each other's houses, listening for long afternoons to our favorite records. Older siblings introduced us to Carly Simon, James Taylor, Carole King, and we would sit and talk and sometimes just sit and listen to the songs, memorizing each one, playing them over and over in our minds. Let's hope that these poem recordings touch that same nerve for you and that they hold the same power that music did. Throughout my life, whenever I read a book I often scribble down a draft of a poem in the back pages. In <em>Poetry Speaks Who I Am</em>, you will find pages at the end where you can write down your own thoughts. Maybe some of the poems in this anthology will stir you to write some poems of your own.</p> <p>We hope you will find inspiring company with these poems and with these poets. As the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke writes: "Live a while in these books..." So live a while with these poems.<br> -Elise Paschen</p></p><h2>Adulting: How to Become a Grown-up in 535 Easy(ish) Steps</h2><p><strong>The "hilarious and super-relatable" (<i>Cosmopolitan</i>) <i>New York Times </i>bestselling guide to living your best life, with a new foreword and updated material </strong><br><br>If you graduated from college but still feel like a student . . . if you wear a business suit to job interviews but pajamas to the grocery store . . . if you have your own apartment but no idea how to cook or clean . . . it's OK.

Unbearable Weight is, in its essence, a profound gift of insight, generosity, understanding. Though this edition marks the tenth anniversary of <i>Unbearable Weight,</i> these pages are as uncanny, insightful, and welcoming now as they were then.

Think relevancy. </b> <i> <b>Think Critically.</b> </i> <br> <i>Think Critically</i>, 2016 presents critical thinking as the optimal approach for solving real-world problems and making important decisions, boosting the relevance of course material to students&#x2019; lives. Authors Peter Facione and Carol Ann Gittens employ a simple, practical approach to deliver the core concepts of critical thinking in a way that students can easily understand. Incorporating contemporary material from a wide range of real-life situations, <i>Think Critically</i>&#x2019;s engaging examples and exercises hammer home positive critical thinking habits of mind that students can use &#x2014; in the classroom and beyond. <br> <br> <i>Think Critically</i>, 2016 is also available via <b>REVEL</b>&#x2122;, an immersive learning experience designed for the way today's students read, think, and learn. <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Peter A. Facione</b>, PhD, has dedicated himself to helping people build their critical thinking to become better problem solvers and decisions makers. He does this work not only to help individuals and groups achieve their own goals, but also for the sake of our freedom and democracy. Facione draws on experience as a teacher, consultant, business entrepreneur, university dean, grandfather, husband, musician, and sports enthusiast. Now he is taking his message about the importance of critical thinking directly to students through <i>Think Critically</i>.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve paid very close attention to the way people make decisions since I was 13 years old,&#x201d; says Facione. &#x201c;Some people were good at solving problems and making decisions; others were not. I have always felt driven to figure out how to tell which were which.&#x201d; He says that this led him as an undergraduate and later as a professor to study psychology, philosophy, logic, statistics, and information systems as he searched for how our beliefs, values, thinking skills, and habits of mind connect with the decisions we make, particularly in contexts of risk and uncertainty.<br> <br>A native Midwesterner, Facione earned his PhD in Philosophy from Michigan State University and his BA in Philosophy from Sacred Heart College in Detroit. He says, &#x201c;Critical thinking has helped me be a better parent, citizen, leader, consultant, teacher, writer, coach, husband, and friend. It even helps a little when playing point guard!&#x201d; In academia, Facione served as provost of Loyola University&#x2013;Chicago, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Santa Clara University, and dean of the School of Human Development and Community Service at California State University&#x2013;Fullerton. &#x201c;As a dean and provost, I could easily see that critical thinking was alive and well in every professional field and academic discipline.&#x201d;<br> <br>Facione spearheaded the international study to define critical thinking, sponsored by the American Philosophical Association. His research formed the basis for numerous government policy studies about critical thinking in the workplace, including research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education. Published by Insight Assessment, his tools for assessing reasoning are used around the world in educational, business, legal, military, and health sciences. Today, Peter operates his own business, Measured Reasons. He is senior level consultant, speaker, writer, and workshop presenter.

She is the project editor for the Keys to Painting series, as well as many of North Light&#39;s Basic Techniques series. She lives in Cincinnati, Ohio.As prolific editor and artist Wolf rightly notes, "Light elicits a host of reactions from us humans. Light is also the foundation for art. Without light there is no contrast, no color, no vision. Certainly, light's primacy and symbolic power make it the most compelling subject for the visual artist." Here, Wolf bears out her argument with 124 stunning examples by 95 artists, who also append brief statements about each work. This is an inspiring, visually rich volume but certainly not an essential purchase if one owns Wolf's previous volume on the same subject, Splash 4: The Splendor of Light. Either is a good choice for advanced artists.

This phenomenon seems to be particularly common in the field of psychotherapy. The charisma effect: when the words sound convincing and the teacher teaches well, but the concepts disintegrate in practice. <p>Well, now Rob Fisher steps forward with a new book entitled Experiential Psychotherapy with Couples: A Guide for the Creative Pragmatist, in which he not only describes the approach, he explains step by step how to put it into action. Depth and brevity are the two guideposts of the writing, and ample case material and innovative exercises clarify the experiential techniques presented as well as their underlying principles. Fisher&#x2019;s approach helps to move clients (and therapists) from insight to impact as it uncovers opportunities to access and then shift the couple&#x2019;s negative interactive impulses &#x2013; by engaging them thoughtfully rather than denying their purpose -- toward creating a more satisfying and balanced relationship. </p><p>For therapists of any discipline, this book offers practical ways both to understand and to intervene with couples across several dimensions simultaneously. Since issues exist on many levels, so too should therapy if it is to be truly effective and enduring. Rob Fisher&#x2019;s goal? For readers not only to find the book "interesting," but for them to be able to customize and employ what they learn within their own clinical practice.</p></p><p>Filled with clear examples and exercises, this book offers practical guidelines to therapists interested in experiential orientation -- <i>Richard C.

Is there any way to overcome that doubt?<br> With pastoral love and concern, John MacArthur answers the second question with an authoritative yes! He carefully examines the classical biblical texts affirming the forever quality of salvation, but does not ignore the troubling passages that seem to indicate otherwise. From there he shows how those truths apply to you by presenting eleven biblical tests to help you determine whether you've experienced salvation once and for all. He concludes by showing how you can match up your feelings with your faith, and by taking an encouraging look at victory in the Spirit and the promise of God to help you persevere.<br> <br> DR.

Each chapter focuses a specific strategic situation as a way of introducing core concepts informally at first, then more fully, with a minimum of mathematics. At the heart of the book is a diverse collection of strategic scenarios, not only from business and politics, but from history, fiction, sports, and everyday life as well. With this approach, students don&#39;t just learn clever answers to puzzles, but instead acquire genuine insights into human behavior.</p><p><b>Joseph E. Harrington, Jr.</b> is Professor of Economics at Johns Hopkins University. He has served on numerous editorial boards, including the <i>RAND</i> <i>Journal of Economics</i>, <i>Foundations and Trends in Microeconomics</i>, and the <i>Southern Economic Journal</i>.

It not only covers all the topics I would cover but does so with the clarity and precision that game theory demands while at the same time providing engaging applications/examples...Harrington&#39;s game theory text is indeed the &#39;unique best response&#39; for anyone who faces an adoption decision for an undergraduate game theory course.&#39; - Klaus Becker, Texas Tech University, USA &#39;This book is outstanding. It&#39;s written with humour and patience and is extremely accessible to students, while still being as rigorous as any advanced text in the area. The book is both a theorist&#39;s and a student&#39;s delight!&#39; - Thomas Jeitschko, Michigan State University, USA &#39;One advantage of [Harrington&#39;s] text over others is that it spends a lot of time turning situations into games, and makes a good amount of effort to motivate the payoffs used, while being clear that these are typically just assumptions. Determining payoffs in games is often as much art as science, and this text seems to do a better job than most of making this known.&#39; - Nick Feltovich, University of Houston, USA &#39;Harrington introduces all of the topics you would think would be in an introductory game theory text, but what makes it exceptional is the patience and care in which he spends time seeing what the theory can buy him. That is, there are very good applications to both better show how the theory works, but also to help explain many real-world situations through the lens of game theory.&#39; - Jesse Schwartz, Kennesaw State University, USA &#39;[Harrington&#39;s text] is a well-written, well-structured introductory game theory textbook appropriate for an audience consisting of undergraduates majoring in different fields.&#39; - Giacomo Bonanno, University of California, Davis, USA</p><h2>Diagnostic Pathology: Kidney Diseases</h2><p><p>Comprehensive and up to date, the third edition of <i>Diagnostic Pathology: Kidney Diseases, </i>written by<i> </i>Robert B.

This volume includes chapters on plants, flowers, fruits, and animals of the earth, air, and water, as well as fantastical creatures such as centaurs, griffons, and dragons. The vivid illustrations, which include paintings and tapestries from some of the world&#39;s premier museums, are accompanied by texts that offer a careful analysis of the artists&#39; depictions of the natural world. fruit, or animal portrayed, its mythic or literary origins, and the episodes or individuals associated with it. These salient points are also called out in summary form within each entry, making the information easily accessible. The reader discovers, for example, that the iris can represent Jesus or the purity of the Virgin Mary as well as the kings of France or the city of Florence. The monkey, which can be symbolic of the devil, heresy, or bad temper, is also associated with the three wise men who travelled to Bethlehem to pay homage to the infant Jesus.</p><p>Following up on four previous titles explaining mythological and biblical iconography in paintings, the latest in the Getty's superb series does not disappoint. The myriad plants, flowers, fruits, animals (land, flying and aquatic) and "Creatures of the Imagination" that appear in medieval and Renaissance painting all have symbolic meanings; Impelluso devotes chapters to each of those categories, further dividing them by object: everything from quinces, myrtle and hyacinth to snakes, grasshoppers, sphinxes and harpies get their due. Impelluso (<i>Gods and Heroes in Art</i>) identifies their prominent appearances in various masterworks and explains their varying significances. Most of the reproductions are centered on the page, with small blocks of text surrounding them, with unobtrusive lines connecting the text to the actual objects it describes. It works beautifully, making the often ignored, busy backgrounds of many less-discussed works&#x2014;like Lucas Cranach the Elder's <i>The Virgin Under the Apple Tree</i> and Leonardo da Vinci's <i>Lady with an Ermine</i>&#x2014;come alive with meaning. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Impelluso's delectable visual dictionary neatly explicates the symbolic and even magical meanings inherent in depictions of the natural world in traditional Western art, images that constitute a lost language just like the allusions De Rynck reveals. In order to reclaim this forgotten knowledge so that even when viewing a "simple still life" readers will understand that "every single fruit, flower, or animal is charged with a specific, characteristic significance," Impelluso organizes her guide into sections on plants, flowers, fruits, land animals, flying animals, aquatic animals, and creatures of the imagination. The meanings associated with, say, the rose, or the orange, the horse, the parrot, the dolphin, or the unicorn, are briskly elucidated, and premier examples are highlighted in 400 astutely chosen masterworks, each crisply reproduced and enhanced by concise and often surprising explanatory notes. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Since artists increasingly work across traditional media and genres, Ward has developed an alternative classification system for contemporary practice such as 'Art as Entertainment', 'Art as Confrontation', 'Art as Joke' -- categories that help to make sense of otherwise obscure-seeming works. There are also 20 'Spotlight' features which guide readers through encounters with key works.<br><br>Ultimately, the message is that any encounter with a challenging work of contemporary art need not be intimidating or alienating but rather a dramatic, sensually rewarding, and thought-provoking experience.</p><p>Ossian Ward is Head of Content at the Lisson Gallery.

This expanded edition of the unforgettable collection I Never Saw Another Butterfly was occasioned by the loan of the children's art by the State Jewish Museum in Prague to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., for exhibition and for this book.<br><br>The ghetto of Terezin (Theresienstadt), located in the hills outside Prague, was an unusual concentration camp in that it was created to cover up the Nazi genocide of the Jews. Billed as the "Fuhrer's gift to the Jews," this "model ghetto" was the site of a Red Cross inspection visit in 1944 and of a propaganda film produced by the Nazis. Some elderly Jews even paid to enter its protective ghetto walls. With its high proportion of artists and intellectuals, culture flourished in the ghetto -- alongside starvation, disease, and constant dread of the continuous transports to the death camps of the east. Every one of its inhabitants was condemned in advance to die.<br><br>A total of 15,000 children under the age of fifteen passed through the Terezin Concentration Camp between the years 1942 and 1944; less than 100 survived. In these poems and pictures drawn by the young inmates of Terezin, we see the daily misery of these uprooted children, as well as their courage and optimism, their hopes and fears.<br><br>The drawings and poems are all that is left of these children. About those who signed their names to their work, it has been possible to find out a few facts: the year and place of their birth, the date of their transport to Terezin and to Auschwitz, and the date of their death. For most of them that last date was 1944, a year before the end of the war.<br><br>These innocent and honest depictions allow us to see through the eyes of the children what life was like in the ghetto. Birds and butterflies flutter with the looming red roofs of Terezin in the background; a luminous moonlit room betrays the stark interior of the barracks. Pencil line drawings depict the threatening guards, work brigades, and deportations they witnessed. Side by side with the realities are images of hope -- a sailboat guided by a candle, a lighted menorah, children playing in a garden that resembles Eden, figures scaling mountain peaks to liberation.<br><br>The children's poems and drawings, revealing a maturity beyond their years, are haunting reminders of what no child should ever have to see. Each piece of art gives the overwhelming tragedy of genocide a human and individual face.<br><br>This new, expanded edition of I Never Saw Another Butterfly includes many additional drawings and poems chosen from the archives of the State Jewish Museum in Prague by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</p><p>A total of 15,000 children under the age of fifteen passed through the Terezin Concentration Camp between the years 1942-1944; less than 100 survived.

Every one of its inhabitants was condemned in advance to die. These innocent and honest depictions allow us to see through the eyes of the children what life was like in the ghetto. The children&#39;s poems and drawings, revealing maturity beyond their years, are haunting reminders of what no child should ever have to see. This expanded edition of I Never Saw Another Butterfly is published in cooperation with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Czech</p><h2>Drawing for the Absolute and Utter Beginner, Revised: 15th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><b><b>This revised 15th anniversary edition of the bestselling beginning drawing book updates art and text examples to include new student pieces, up-to-date materials, and additional sections on drawing in 3D and travel sketching, along with refreshed and contemporary design.</b></b><br><br>Based on author and art instructor Claire Watson Garcia's successful courses and workshops for beginning and aspiring artists, <i>Drawing for the Absolute and Utter Beginner</i> applies a positive, accepting tone to a progressive series of lessons in sketching and rendering. The book's step-by-step methodology and examples of student works from earliest efforts to completed drawings give novices the tools and techniques needed to make competent and eloquent renderings of still lifes, portraits, and more. In this revised edition, Garcia covers such in-demand subject matter as drawing-on-the-go, drawing in three dimensions, and drawing the portrait at a three-quarter view. The reinvigorated art and text ensure that this drawing instruction classic will continue to appeal to new generations of aspiring artists.</p><p>CLAIRE WATSON GARCIA is an instructor at the prestigious Silvermine School of Art in New Canaan, CT, where her "Absolute and Utter Beginner" courses and workshops have been popular for over 20 years. She is also the author of <i>Painting for the Absolute and Utter Beginner</i>.<b>How to Use This Book </b><br> &nbsp;<br> Following this book&#x2019;s methods, a beginner with no previous art experience can quickly gain enough understanding of the basics to draw recognizable subjects and give them the illusion of dimension. It&#x2019;s important to start at the very beginning of this learn-to-draw process to build a solid foundation in basic concepts and techniques, and also to acquire the confidence that comes from understanding the fundamentals.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book is designed as a cumulative learning experience. Each chapter builds on skills acquired in the previous; projects become increasingly challenging while staying within reach. The book maintains a linear sequence from chapters 1 through 4, which provide the necessary preparation to take on exercises in subsequent chapters; you can then pursue the remaining chapters according to your personal interests.<br> &nbsp;<br> Along with basic drawing techniques, I&#x2019;ve also included instruction in another important skill: the ability to evaluate your drawings constructively. This will allow you to accelerate your drawing progress, learn more about yourself and your art, and challenge obstacles to learning like performance anxiety and harsh self-judgment.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>The Beginners Speak <br></b><br>I&#x2019;ve illustrated this book with drawings from beginners who completed the same assignments on which you&#x2019;ll be working. It has been fascinating to see that beginners show an innate preference for certain shapes, visual contrasts, and rhythms that show up immediately in their drawings. This personal style appears without conscious effort, and is integral to each person&#x2019;s approach to drawing. You too will learn how to express your own unique style in the most fulfilling way as your technical skills develop.<br> Approach drawing as a magical activity to do, to learn, and to see&#x2014;profound, mysterious, and gratifying. Guided by the sequence of instruction and wise words from fellow beginners, you&#x2019;ll have an art adventure&#x2014;full of challenges, yes, but discoveries and rewards as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Getting Organized&nbsp;<br></b><br> Set aside time on a regular basis to exercise your artistic capacity. It doesn&#x2019;t have to involve a relentless, rigid schedule, where you&#x2019;ll feel guilty if you don&#x2019;t abide by it. But recognize that this new part of you needs time to flourish, whenever you can find the opportunity to engage it.<br><br> Do you have a place to draw? Since the practice of art is new to you, it&#x2019;s likely you&#x2019;ve borrowed space in the kitchen or in a bedroom. However, to ensure that the people you live with respect your space, it&#x2019;s a good idea to let them know what you&#x2019;re up to and where, especially if the apple on the kitchen counter they want to eat is part of your still life!<br><br> Keep your drawings and art supplies within reach, and in one place. To protect your work, I suggest you buy an inexpensive portfolio, large enough to hold your largest sheets of paper. That way you can save your work easily for later review. If you assemble your supplies in a toolbox or even a cardboard shoe box, you can keep all of your pencils, pens, and other supplies out of sight. A card table and chair can provide you with a mobile temporary studio. Searching for the perfect work conditions can be a form of procrastination, so just remember: a drawing can begin with only a piece of paper and a pencil.</p><h2>1000 Essential Vocabulary for the JLPT N5 (Trilingue en Japonais - Anglais - Chinois) (N4, 4)</h2><p><b>Big hit vocabulary series!<b><br><br> -Memorize related vocabulary words by learning them by theme!

Hill (Ph.D., University of Michigan) is associate professor of Old Testament studies at Wheaton College, Illinois. John H. Walton (Ph.D., Hebrew Union College) teaches Old Testament and Hebrew at Moody Bible Institute, Chicago. He is the author of several other Zondervan books, including Chronological and Background Charts of the Old TestamentThis innovative textbook at long last provides an Old Testament survey for undergraduate students that goes beyond basic content. The book attempts to balance the literary, historical, and theological issues pertaining to each individual book and to the Old Testament as a whole. The main portion of the survey treats each book of the Old Testament in the order of the English canon. This information does not simply rehash the biblical material, but assumes that the Scriptures are being read alongside the survey. The book focuses its primary attention on the purpose and message of each book and attempts to show how the literary structure of each one has been used to accomplish the author&#39;s purpose. The survey also introduces readers to the issues of hermeneutics (general and special), history (Israelite and Near Eastern), archaeology, canon, geography, Old Testament theology (biblical and systematic), and critical methodologies. All these issues are dealt with in separate chapters at a basic introductory level that never allows the reader to lose sight, as it were, of the forest while wandering through the trees. In addressing critical issues of date and authorship, the survey avoids a polemical stance. Hill and Watson seek to depend on the evidence of the text rather than on presuppositions to substantiate their views. Their commitment to the authority of the biblical text results in a book that, while notably evangelical, is not always traditional. The authors approach the survey mindful of two complicating factors in Old Testament study. First, God&#39;s revelation did not come by way of the English language or through Western culture, and therefore we today have to work carefully to receive the message clearly. Second, even when we are listening, we have a tendency to be selective about what we hear or to try to make the message conform to our ideas. The solution is to allow the Bible to speak for itself. The informed reader will find much innovation here and a keen awareness of current scholarship relating to the Old Testament. Above all, this textbook will bring a new vigor and excitement to the Old Testament as readers learn to discover its story for themselves and see how to understand it as a substantial part of God&#39;s self-revelation to humankind. This survey is well illustrated with maps, charts, and photographs. Additional features are the questions for study and the annotated reading list at the end of each chapter.</p><h2>Introduction to Restoration Ecology (The Science and Practice of Ecological Restoration Series)</h2><p>Restoration ecology is a young field that integrates theory and knowledge from a range of disciplines, including the biological, physical, and social sciences as well as the humanities. This new textbook, written for upper-division undergraduates and first-year graduate students, offers a real-life introduction to the field and an interdisciplinary overview of the theory behind it.&nbsp;<br> Developed by ecologists and landscape architects, each of whom has been involved in restoration research and practice for many years, the focus of the book is on providing a framework that can be used to guide restoration decisions anywhere on the globe, both now and in the future. The text is organized around a restoration process that has been tested and revised by the authors in their restoration ecology courses taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison over the past thirty years.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each chapter includes a series of "Food for Thought" questions that both help students review concepts and put them to work in solving conservation problems. The framework is designed to work with the uniqueness, uncertainty, messiness, and constraints inherent in any real-world restoration project.<br> &nbsp;<br> Success in ecological restoration requires not only technical proficiency but also skill in the social, cultural, and political arenas. Introduction to Restoration Ecology can help students develop the skills they need to succeed in all of these areas and is a much-needed new resource.<br></p><p>Evelyn Howell, plant ecologist, and John Harrington, landscape architect, are Professors in the Department of Landscape Architecture, University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Ambrose describes the expedition of Lewis and Clark across the North American continent and back (from May 1804 to December 1806) as "the greatest camping trip of all time, and the greatest hunting trip. And one of the greatest scientific expeditions ever." It's a trip that Ambrose and his family often emulate, camping in the same lands the expedition first encountered nearly two centuries before them. In 1997, he was accompanied by <i>National Geographic</i> photographer Sam Abell. Some of these stunning pictures lead off the account of the journey presented here, and then pepper the second half of the book, which is also filled with period illustrations and maps. Ambrose has told the story of Lewis and Clark before, in the bestselling <i>Undaunted Courage</i>; the version he tells in <i>Voyage of Discovery</i> is shorter, but is also filled with his own contemporary reflections upon the men and the lands they traveled. This coffee-table book will delight lovers of history and nature alike, and may well inspire you to pack up your gear and hit the trail.Don't expect Ambrose's second treatment of the Lewis and Clark expedition to retread his <i>Undaunted Courage</i> (1996), a huge-selling biography of Meriwether Lewis. An inspection of both books reveals only tiny verbatim repetition, and the cause soon becomes clear: whereas the biography held to the form's stricture that the author be detached from his subject, this photo album proclaims Ambrose's 20-year-long personal obsession (as he puts it) with the epic story. Since 1976 he and his family have spent their summers along the route taken by the Corps of Discovery; some family members have even moved to Montana because of their devotional interest in Lewis and Clark. Ambrose, drawing on his hikes and canoe trips to all the monuments between St. Louis and Fort Clatsop associated with the explorers, melds his memories and own journal entries with a new Lewis and Clark narrative spiced by entries from their journals. Akin to religious pilgrims, Ambrose and companions (including Dayton Duncan and film producer Ken Burns) often re-read passages from those journals at the locale an entry was written, allowing Ambrose to comment on the place's contemporary appearance, whether pristine (Gates of the Rocky Mountains), or altered (the dammed-up Missouri River). The visual difference between Duncan and Burns' <i>Lewis &amp; Clark</i> (1997) and this Ambrose treatment is notable: the former uses nineteenth-century paintings; the latter contemporary National Geo-style photographs of the vistas. Ambrose remarks that his obsession changed his life, and surely his travelogue/tribute will change the vacation plans of some readers as well. Popular, beyond doubt. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>The Broadview Anthology of Victorian Poetry &amp; Poetic Theory</h2><p><p> <em>The Broadview Anthology of Victorian Poetry and Poetic Theory</em> is the most comprehensive collection of poetry from the period ever published.

Seven years later, The Invisible Committee follows up their premonitory manifesto with a new book, <i>To Our Friends</i>.</p><p>From The Invisible Committee:</p><p><i>In 2007 we published </i>The Coming Insurrection <i>in France. It must be acknowledged that a number of assertions by the Invisible Committee have since been confirmed, starting with the first and most essential: the sensational return of the insurrectionary phenomenon. Who would have bet a kopeck, seven years ago, on the overthrow of Ben Ali or Mubarak through street action, on the revolt of young people in Quebec, on the political awakening of Brazil, on the fires set French-style in the English or Swedish </i>banlieues<i>, on the creation of an insurrectionary commune in the very heart of Istanbul, on a movement of plaza occupations in the United States, or on the rebellion that spread throughout Greece in December of 2008?</i></p><p><i>During the seven years that separate </i>The Coming Insurrection <i>from </i>To Our Friends<i>, the agents of the Invisible Committee have continued to fight, to organize, to transport themselves to the four corners of the world, to wherever the fires were lit, and to debate with comrades of every tendency and every country.

The Tuskegee Study had nothing to do with treatment. Its purpose was to trace the spontaneous evolution of the disease in order to learn how syphilis affected black subjects.<br> <br>The men were not told they had syphilis; they were not warned about what the disease might do to them; and, with the exception of a smattering of medication during the first few months, they were not given health care. Instead of the powerful drugs they required, they were given aspirin for their aches and pains. Health officials systematically deceived the men into believing they were patients in a government study of &#x201c;bad blood&#x201d;, a catch-all phrase black sharecroppers used to describe a host of illnesses. At the end of this 40 year deathwatch, more than 100 men had died from syphilis or related complications.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bad Blood&#x201d; provides compelling answers to the question of how such a tragedy could have been allowed to occur. Tracing the evolution of medical ethics and the nature of decision making in bureaucracies, Jones attempted to show that the Tuskegee Study was not, in fact, an aberration, but a logical outgrowth of race relations and medical practice in the United States.<br> <br>Now, in this revised edition of &#x201c;Bad Blood&#x201d;, Jones traces the tragic consequences of the Tuskegee Study over the last decade. A new introduction explains why the Tuskegee Study has become a symbol of black oppression and a metaphor for medical neglect, inspiring a prize-winning play, a Nova special, and a motion picture. A new concluding chapter shows how the black community's wide-spread anger and distrust caused by the Tuskegee Study has hampered efforts by health officials to combat AIDS in the black community. &#x201c;Bad Blood&#x201d; was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and was one of the &#x201c;N.Y.

The Tuskegee Study, as the experiment had come to be called, involved a substantial number of men: 399 who had syphilis and an additional 201 who were free of the disease chosen to serve as controls. All of the syphilitic men were in the late stage of the disease when the study began.<br><br>Under examination by the press the PHS was not able to locate a formal protocol for the experiment. Later it was learned that one never existed; procedures, it seemed, had simply evolved. A variety of tests and medical examinations were performed on the men during scores of visits by PHS physicians over the years, but the basic procedures called for periodic blood testing and routine autopsies to supplement the information that was obtained through clinical examinations. The fact that only men who had late, so-called tertiary, syphilis were selected for the study indicated that the investigators were eager to learn more about the serious complications that result during the final phase of the disease.<br><br>The PHS officers were not disappointed. Published reports on the experiment consistently showed higher rates of mortality and morbidity among the syphilitics than the controls. In fact, the press reported that as of 1969 at least 28 and perhaps as many as 100 men had died as a direct result of complications caused by syphilis. Others had developed serious syphilis-related heart conditions that may have contributed to their deaths.<br><br>The Tuskegee Study had nothing to do with treatment. No new drugs were tested; neither was any effort made to establish the efficacy of old forms of treatment. It was a nontherapeutic experiment, aimed at compiling data on the effects of the spontaneous evolution of syphilis on black males. The magnitude of the risks taken with the lives of the subjects becomes clearer once a few basic facts about the disease are known.<br><br>Syphilis is a highly contagious disease caused by the <i>Treponema pallidum,</i> a delicate organism that is microscopic in size and resembles a corkscrew in shape. The disease may be acquired or congenital. In acquired syphilis, the spirochete (as the <i>Treponema pallidum</i> is also called) enters the body through the skin or mucous membrane, usually during sexual intercourse, though infection may also occur from other forms of bodily contact such as kissing. Congenital syphilis is transmitted to the fetus in the infected mother when the spirochete penetrates the placental barrier.<br><br>From the onset of infection syphilis is a generalized disease involving tissues throughout the entire body. Once they wiggle their way through the skin or mucous membrane, the spirochetes begin to multiply at a frightening rate. First they enter the lymph capillaries where they are hurried along to the nearest lymph gland. There they multiply and work their way into the bloodstream. Within days the spirochetes invade every part of the body.<br><br>Three stages mark the development of the disease: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary stage lasts from ten to sixty days starting from the time of infection. During this "first incubation period," the primary lesion of syphilis, the chancre, appears at the point of contact, usually on the genitals. The chancre, typically a slightly elevated, round ulcer, rarely causes personal discomfort and may be so small as to go unnoticed. If it does not become secondarily infected, the chancre will heal without treatment within a month or two, leaving a scar that persists for several months.<br><br>While the chancre is healing, the second stage begins. Within six weeks to six months, a rash appears signaling the development of secondary syphilis. The rash may resemble measles, chicken pox, or any number of skin eruptions, though occasionally it is so mild as to go unnoticed. Bones and joints often become painful, and circulatory disturbances such as cardiac palpitations may develop. Fever, indigestion, headaches, or other nonspecific symptoms may accompany the rash. In some cases skin lesions develop into moist ulcers teeming with spirochetes, a condition that is especially severe when the rash appears in the mouth and causes open sores that are viciously infectious. Scalp hair may drop out in patches, creating a "moth-eaten" appearance. The greatest proliferation and most widespread distribution of spirochetes throughout the body occurs in secondary syphilis.<br><br>Secondary syphilis gives way in most cases, even without treatment, to a period of latency that may last from a few weeks to thirty years. As if by magic, all symptoms of the disease seem to disappear, and the syphilitic patient does not associate with the disease's earlier symptoms the occasional skin infections, periodic chest pains, eye disorders, and vague discomforts that may follow. But the spirochetes do not vanish once the disease becomes latent. They bore into the bone marrow, lymph glands, vital organs, and central nervous systems of their victims. In some cases the disease seems to follow a policy of peaceful coexistence, and its hosts are able to enjoy full and long lives. Even so, autopsies in such cases often reveal syphilitic lesions in vital organs as contributing causes of death. For many syphilitic patients, however, the disease remains latent only two or three years. Then the delusion of a truce is shattered by the appearance of signs and symptoms that denote the tertiary stage.<br><br>It is during late syphilis, as the tertiary stage is also called, that the disease inflicts the greatest damage. Gummy or rubbery tumors (so-called gummas), the characteristic lesions of late syphilis, appear, resulting from the concentration of spirochetes in the body's tissues with destruction of vital structures. These tumors often coalesce on the skin forming large ulcers covered with a crust consisting of several layers of dried exuded matter. Their assaults on bone structure produce deterioration that resembles osteomyelitis or bone tuberculosis. The small tumors may be absorbed, leaving slight scarred depressions, or they may cause wholesale destruction of the bone, such as the horrible mutilation that occurs when nasal and palate bones are eaten away. The liver may also be attacked: here the result is scarring and deformity of the organ that impede circulation from the intestines.<br><br>The cardiovascular and central nervous systems are frequent and often fatal targets of late syphilis. The tumors may attack the walls of the heart or the blood vessels. When the aorta is involved, the walls become weakened, scar tissue forms over the lesion, the artery dilates, and the valves of the heart no longer open and close properly and begin to leak. The stretching of the vessel walls may produce an aneurysm, a balloonlike bulge in the aorta. If the bulge bursts, and sooner or later most do, the result is sudden death.<br><br>The results of neurosyphilis are equally devastating. Syphilis is spread to the brain through the blood vessels, and while the disease can take several forms, the best known is paresis, a general softening of the brain that produces progressive paralysis and insanity. Tabes dorsalis, another form of neurosyphilis, produces a stumbling, foot-slapping gait in its victims due to the destruction of nerve cells in the spinal cord. Syphilis can also attack the optic nerve, causing blindness, or the eighth cranial nerve, inflicting deafness. Since nerve cells lack regenerative power, all such damage is permanent.<br><br>The germ that causes syphilis, the stages of the disease's development, and the complications that can result from untreated syphilis were all known to medical science in 1932 -- the year the Tuskegee Study began.<br><br>Since the effects of the disease are so serious, reporters in 1972 wondered why the men agreed to cooperate. The press quickly established that the subjects were mostly poor and illiterate, and that the PHS had offered them incentives to participate. The men received free physical examinations, free rides to and from the clinics, hot meals on examination days, free treatment for minor ailments, and a guarantee that burial stipends would be paid to their survivors. Though the latter sum was very modest (fifty dollars in 1932 with periodic increases to allow for inflation), it represented the only form of burial insurance that many of the men had.<br><br>What the health officials had told the men in 1932 was far more difficult to determine. An officer of the venereal disease branch of the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, the agency that was in charge of the Tuskegee Study in 1972, assured reporters that the participants were told at the beginning that they had syphilis and were told what the disease could do to them, and that they were given the opportunity to withdraw from the program any time and receive treatment. But a physician with firsthand knowledge of the experiment's early years directly contradicted this statement. Dr. J. W. Williams, who was serving his internship at Andrews Hospital at the Tuskegee Institute in 1932 and assisted in the experiment's clinical work, stated that neither the interns nor the subjects knew what the study involved. "The people who came in were not told what was being done," Dr. Williams said. "We told them we wanted to test them. They were not told, so far as I know, what they were being treated for or what they were not being treated for." As far as he could tell, the subjects "thought they were being treated for rheumatism or bad stomachs." He did recall administering to the men what he thought were drugs to combat syphilis, and yet as he thought back on the matter, Dr. Williams conjectured that "some may have been a placebo." He was absolutely certain of one point: "We didn't tell them we were looking for syphilis. I don't think they would have known what that was."<br><br>A subject in the experiment said much the same thing. Charles Pollard recalled clearly the day in 1932 when some men came by and told him that he would receive a free physical examination if he appeared the next day at a nearby one-room school. "So I went on over and they told me I had bad blood," Pollard recalled. "And that's what they've been telling me ever since. They come around from time to time and check me over and they say, 'Charlie, you've got bad blood.'"<br><br>An official of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) stated that he understood the term "bad blood" was a synonym for syphilis in the black community. Pollard replied, "That could be true. But I never heard no such thing. All I knew was that they just kept saying I had the bad blood -- they never mentioned syphilis to me, not even once." Moreover, he thought that he had been receiving treatment for "bad blood" from the first meeting on, for Pollard added: "They been doctoring me off and on ever since then, and they gave me a blood tonic."<br><br>The PHS's version of the Tuskegee Study came under attack from yet another quarter when Dr. Reginald G. James told his story to reporters. Between 1939 and 1941 he had been involved with public health work in Macon County -- specifically the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis. Assigned to work with him was Eunice Rivers, a black nurse employed by the Public Health Service to keep track of the participants in the Tuskegee Study. "When we found one of the men from the Tuskegee Study," Dr. James recalled, "she would say, 'He's under study and not to be treated.'" These encounters left him, by his own description, "distraught and disturbed," but whenever he insisted on treating such a patient, the man never returned. "They were being advised they shouldn't take treatments or they would be dropped from the study," Dr. James stated. The penalty for being dropped, he explained, was the loss of the benefits that they had been promised for participating.<br><br>Once her identity became known, Nurse Rivers excited considerable interest, but she steadfastly refused to talk with reporters. Details of her role in the experiment came to light when newsmen discovered an article about the Tuskegee Study that appeared in <i>Public Health Reports</i> in 1953. Involved with the study from its beginning, Nurse Rivers served as the liaison between the researchers and the subjects. She lived in Tuskegee and provided the continuity in personnel that was vital. For while the names and faces of the "government doctors" changed many times over the years, Nurse Rivers remained a constant. She served as a facilitator, bridging the many barriers that stemmed from the educational and cultural gap between the physicians and the subjects. Most important, the men trusted her.<br><br>As the years passed the men came to understand that they were members of a social club and burial society called "Miss Rivers' Lodge." She kept track of them and made certain that they showed up to be examined whenever the "government doctors" came to town. She often called for them at their homes in a shiny station wagon with the government emblem on the front door and chauffeured them to and from the place of examination. According to the <i>Public Health Reports</i> article, these rides became "a mark of distinction for many of the men who enjoyed waving to their neighbors as they drove by." There was nothing to indicate that the members of "Miss Rivers' Lodge" knew they were participating in a deadly serious experiment.<br><br>Spokesmen for the Public Health Service were quick to point out that the experiment was never kept secret, as many newspapers had incorrectly reported when the story first broke. Far from being clandestine, the Tuskegee Study had been the subject of numerous reports in medical journals and had been openly discussed in conferences at professional meetings. An official told reporters that more than a dozen articles had appeared in some of the nation's best medical journals, describing the basic procedures of the study to a combined readership of well over a hundred thousand physicians. He denied that the Public Health Service had acted alone in the experiment, calling it a cooperative project that involved the Alabama State Department of Health, the Tuskegee Institute, the Tuskegee Medical Society, and the Macon County Health Department.<br><br>Apologists for the Tuskegee Study contended that it was at best problematic whether the syphilitic subjects could have been helped by the treatment that was available when the study began. In the early 1930s treatment consisted of mercury and two arsenic compounds called arsphenamine and neoarsphenamine, known also by their generic name, salvarsan. The drugs were highly toxic and often produced serious and occasionally fatal reactions in patients. The treatment was painful and usually required more than a year to complete. As one CDC officer put it, the drugs offered "more potential harm for the patient than potential benefit."<br><br>PHS officials argued that these facts suggested that the experiment had not been conceived in a moral vacuum. For if the state of the medical art in the early 1930s had nothing better than dangerous and less than totally effective treatment to offer, then it followed that, in the balance, little harm was done by leaving the men untreated.<br><br>Discrediting the efficacy of mercury and salvarsan helped blunt the issue of withholding treatment during the early years, but public health officials had a great deal more difficulty explaining why penicillin was denied in the 1940s. One PHS spokesman ventured that it probably was not "a one-man decision" and added philosophically, "These things seldom are."

The muscles of the face can be exercised and toned just like skeletal muscles. With this new program a marked difference in appearance will be developed and will potentially eliminate the common desire and need for invasive plastic surgery. </p><p> Too much sun, cigarette smoking, the degradation of collagen layers and poor skin create sagging facial muscles. Performing the facial gymnastics in this program on a regular basis will reverse a variety of concerns such as "empty" looking cheekbones, floppy jowls, relaxed eyelids, uncomely wrinkles and too much unwelcome elasticity. Catherine Pez prescribes a "facial gym" at home to exercise the muscles in the face with no special equipment -- just some diligence and discipline. </p><p> The smile works more than twenty five muscles on the face -- so smiling is an important first step. The small and important Risorius muscle is in the corner of the mouth and if well stimulated, will correct a drooping mouth. This muscle also stimulates the other mid-face muscles thereby inflating the cheeks and nothing is as fresh and young-looking as well-accentuated cheekbones. </p><p> Each exercise has clear instructions, with photographs that demonstrate the movements, so performing each exercise is easy and straightforward. </p></p><p><p> Catherine Pez has taught her facial gymnastics method for several years.

Indeed it is only when the subject is stripped of its mathematics that one begins to realize how difficult it is to pin down and describe those structural concepts which are often called&#39; elementary&#39;; by which I suppose we mean &#39;basic&#39; or &#39;fundamental&#39;. Some of the omis� sions and oversimplifications are intentional but no doubt some of them are due to my own brute ignorance and lack of under� standing of the subject. Although this volume is more or less a sequel to The New Science of Strong Materials it can be read as an entirely separate book in its own right. For this reason a certain amount of repeti� tion has been unavoidable in the earlier chapters. I have to thank a great many people for factual information, suggestions and for stimulating and sometimes heated discussions. Among the living, my colleagues at Reading University have been generous with help, notably Professor W. D.

He took a degree in naval architecture at Glasgow University and worked in wood and steel shipyards, intending to design sailing ships. On the outbreak of the Second World War he moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, where he worked on wooden aircraft, plastics and unorthodox materials of all kinds. He designed the sailing rescue dinghies carried at one time by most bomber aircraft. He later became head of the plastic structures sections at Farnborough and developed a method of construction in reinforced plastics which is now used for a number of purpose in aircraft and rockets. For several frustrating years he worked in industry on the strength of glass and the growth of strong &#39;whisker&#39; crystals. In 1962 he returned to government service as superintendent of an experimental branch at Waltham Abbey concerned with research and development of entirely new structural materials, most of which were based on &#39;whiskers&#39;. He was Industrial Fellow Commoner at Churchill College, Cambridge, and became Professor of Materials Technology at the University of Reading, where he was later Professor Emeritus. He was awarded the British Silver Medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society for work on aircraft plastics and also the Griffith Medal of the Materials Science Club for contributions to material science. His book, Structures or Why Things Don&#39;t Fall Down, is also published in Penguin. Professor Gordon died in 1998. In its obituary The Times wrote of him that he was &#39;one of the founders of materials science&#39; and that he wrote &#39;two books of outstanding literary quality ... at once entertaining and informative, providing absorbing interest for both expert and student&#39;."It is really, really good if you want a primer on structural design."&#x2015;<b>Elon Musk</b><br><br>"Rich and readable...personal, witty, and ironic."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Scientific American</i></i></b><br><br>"Here we have the conversation in the unbuttoned mood of a learned engineer with wide sympathies about his art, its history, its range, and the silly things which happen.

Mettler argues that this difficulty is not merely a failure of communication; rather it is endemic to the formidable presence of the &#x201c;submerged state.&#x201d;<br> <br> In recent decades, federal policymakers have increasingly shunned the outright disbursing of benefits to individuals and families and favored instead less visible and more indirect incentives and subsidies, from tax breaks to payments for services to private companies. These submerged policies, Mettler shows, obscure the role of government and exaggerate that of the market. As a result, citizens are unaware not only of the benefits they receive, but of the massive advantages given to powerful interests, such as insurance companies and the financial industry. Neither do they realize that the policies of the submerged state shower their largest benefits on the most affluent Americans, exacerbating inequality. Mettler analyzes three Obama reforms&#x2014;student aid, tax relief, and health care&#x2014;to reveal the submerged state and its consequences, demonstrating how structurally difficult it is to enact policy reforms and even to obtain public recognition for achieving them. She concludes with recommendations for reform to help make hidden policies more visible and governance more comprehensible to all Americans.<br> <br> The sad truth is that many American citizens do not know how major social programs work&#x2014;or even whether they benefit from them. Suzanne Mettler&#x2019;s important new book will bring government policies back to the surface and encourage citizens to reclaim their voice in the political process.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Suzanne Mettler</b> is the Clinton Rossiter Professor of American Institutions at Cornell University.

Patashnik, University of Virginia)</p><h2>The Heroine&#39;s Journey Workbook</h2><p><i>The Heroine's Journey </i> is a woman's mythic quest to heal the deep wounding of her feminine nature on a personal, cultural, and spiritual level. She undertakes this spiritual and psychological journey to become whole, integrating all parts of her nature. Sometimes the journey is conscious, but in many cases it is not. This workbook is designed to guide the reader consciously through the different stages of the <i>Heroine's Journey. </i> Based on workshops conducted by the author with women of all ages, it can be used individually or in a group. The reader will explore each stage of the journey and look at the myths and fairy tales that shed light on these archetypal experiences: Separation from the Feminine, in which a woman searches for an identity in a masculine-defined culture. The Road of Trials, in which she challenges the myths of female inferiority, dependency, and romantic love. Spiritual Aridity, a feeling of having lost herself in her struggle for achievement. Initiation and Descent, a period of drawing inward and looking for the lost pieces of herself. Urgent yearning to reconnect with the Feminine and heal the Mother-Daughter Split. Integrating and healing the wounded parts of her inner Masculine. The Sacred Marriage, which occurs as she learns to integrate and balance all aspects of herself. The chapters include questions for reflection as well as exercises in guided imagery, writing, art, and dreamwork to bring clarity and understanding to the quest. Finally, the skills learned on this archetypal journey prepare a woman to work toward the larger quest of bringing consciousness to others and preserving the balance of life on earth.</p><p>Maureen Murdock is a licensed family therapist in private practice in Venice, California, and teaches in the UCLA Extension Writer's Program. She is also the internationally published author of <i>The Heroine's Journey, Spinning Inward, </i>and<i> Fathers' Daughters. </i> <i>The Heroine's Journey Workbook </i> grew out of her work with women in therapy and workshops conducted throughout North America over the past twenty years."This 'map for every woman's quest, with guided imagery, dreamwork, and creative exercises,' a companion workbook to Murdock's best-selling <i>Heroine's Journey </i>, is an eye-opener. My first jolt came while addressing the author's initial "Question for . . . Reflection," which was, "Who are the heroines in your life . . .?" I could have reeled off a whole list of heroes, but even one heroine was a stretch. There's message enough in that, yes? We'd better get working! And this workbook is a great tool, for individuals or for groups. Skillful prompting and multiple techniques guide readers through various stages of recognition, acceptance, healing, and integration of the feminine. Others' experiences, myths, and fairy tales further combine with personal realizations to produce a much-needed antidote to an affliction of the spirit that haunts us more than we know."&#x2014; <i>NAPRA ReView. </i></p><h2>D. H. Lawrence: Selected Poems (A Viking Compass Book)</h2><p>Lawrence wrote nearly 1,000 poems during a short lifetime in which he was also astonishingly prolific in other spheres - fiction, travel writing, essays, criticism, letters and plays. Lawrence was not simply a novelist who dabbled in other forms. His characteristic vision informed everything he wrote, especially his poetry. At three important phases of his life, it became the primary channel of his experience and creative energy - the first year of his relationship with Frieda, the two years in Sicily, and the last year of his life. Bringing together the best of his poetry, this volume demonstrates that &#39;Lawrence is a great poet in every sense including the technical - the form is the perfect incarnation of the content, the perfect vehicle for the liveliness of thought and feeling, the freshness, and depth of perception, the wit and wisdom he has to offer.&#39;</p><p></p><h2>The Soul of Medicine: Tales from the Bedside</h2><p>&#x201c;Like all doctors, I collect stories...&#x201d; <p>From one of America's most renowned and beloved doctors, and best-selling winner of the National Book Award, comes a remarkable book that brings together the stories of doctors collected over 30 years. Each of these tales, filled with grace and wisdom, explores the mysteries and conundrums of modern medicine. Enhanced by Sherwin Nuland's keen insight into the special relationship between doctor and patient, these engrossing stories illustrate the judgment, wisdom, and character of veteran doctors who have mastered the art of care-giving. Taken together, the lessons learned from <i>The Soul of Medicine</i> are as moving and profound as they are timeless. </p><p>&#x201c;A beautiful book.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Oliver Sacks</b> </p><p>&#x201c;Nuland is a gifted storyteller, bringing his doctors...brilliantly to life.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>John Irving</b></p></p><p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Sherwin Nuland is one of the country's most preeminent doctor-writers. To his books, he brings the perspective of over 30 years of surgical practice and a passion for medical history. The combination has appealed broadly to readers both within and without the ranks of medicine. For doctors, Nuland's voice has validated the realities of a profession from which impossible things are sometimes expected. For patients, his books were among the first to pierce the veil of mystery separating patients from their seemingly all-knowing and all-powerful physicians. The idea for Nuland's newest book, "The Soul of Medicine," is a terrific one. Over the course of his career, both as a practicing surgeon and as a clinical professor at Yale, Nuland has had the chance to work with a host of exceptionally talented doctors in a range of specialties. For "The Soul of Medicine," he has asked 16 of them to tell the story of their most memorable patient and, with two of his own additions, cobbled them together into a modern-day version of "The Canterbury Tales." Here, Canterbury is the fictionalized name of the prestigious medical institution where our storytellers' practices intersect, and the tales themselves are delivered by specialty: The Urologist's Tale, The Pediatrician's Tale and so on. Since the book ostensibly focuses on patients, it's surprising to find physicians so prominent in the stories. The doctors' personalities take over, and the patients and their diagnoses -- rare and perplexing as they may have been -- fade into the background. Far more striking than elusive diagnoses or anatomical oddities are the sometimes touching but frequently galling descriptions of the ways in which these doctors viewed and interacted with their patients and, at times, their subordinate colleagues. It is in these interactions that the book's thematic allusion to "The Canterbury Tales" seems most apt, for many of the tales feel more medieval than modern, more historical retrospective than current commentary. As an example, there is the married surgeon in the 1940s who proudly tells of bedding student nurses in a hospital construction site. When the nursing supervisor catches him, he lies to the hospital president and has her fired. Nuland appropriately chastises the "scoundrel" in his commentary following the tale, but the larger question is, given the revelation of such behavior in Samuel Shem's classic novel "House of God," why include it? Fortunately, "The Soul of Medicine" also contains far more poignant -- and relevant -- examples of physicians' human failings: an anesthesiologist who allows an obviously manic surgeon to proceed with an operation, placing the patient in grave danger; a neurosurgeon who unleashes his fury on a man who beat a boy to death, "want[ing] to be sure that [the man] could see the bits of brain clinging to my gown, the front of which was soaked in the fresh still-scarlet blood of the child he had killed." But the segues into and out of these emotional passages are rapid. As a result, the reader is not given adequate time to contemplate the life-altering moments for both patient and healer that the best of these stories reveal. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post. All Rights Reserved.National Book Award&#x2013;winner Nuland (<i>How We Die</i>) turns over his latest collection to the stories of more than a dozen specialists describing their most memorable patients. What is extraordinary about Nuland's compilation is not the medical heroics but the instances of fallibility and vulnerability that prove the doctor is not just human but caring. A bronchoscopist tells of a famed thoracic surgeon who botches a procedure to recover a small cap a child has swallowed Well, chappies, he chirped, here's my chance to demonstrate the procedure again. Rather like a double feature at the cinema, yes? When that, too, fails, the frustrated surgeon must do major surgery to rectify what should have been a 10-minute fix. Even the scoundrel who gets a nurse fired rather than be caught in his own impropriety shows a recognizable humanity in his hilarious retelling of barging into a procedure unwashed and unwanted, and being chased from the premises by a mad-as-hell surgeon. Nuland adds his own commentary after many of the stories, but it's just window dressing. Here's medicine as it's actually practiced&#x2014;by humans awed by the privilege of both their practice and patients. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p><i>The Art of the Portrait</i> focuses on about a 200-year period, from the late Middle Ages to the Renaissance, during which the genre of painted portraiture flourished. For the first time since classical antiquity, interest in and attention to this type of painting grew. As a consequence, new visual types of portraiture--full length, profiles, groups--emerged, and a wider range of subjects (outside the traditional circle of royalty and clergy) was explored in the canvasses, along with psychological and atmospheric elements. During this heyday innumerable masterpieces were painted by a wealth of different artists. But the 19th century, with the advent of photography and impressionism, among other developments, put an abrupt end to the boom. <p> The paintings collected in this book include Botticelli's <i>Profile of a Young Woman</i>, in which his subject is draped in a lovely deep-red gown with pearls threaded through her intricately braided hair; Jan van Eyck's <i>The Marriage of Giovanni Arnolfini</i>, which doubled as something of a marriage certificate for the couple, as it attested to the presence of a witness (the artist himself) at the priestless ceremony; and da Vinci's Mona Lisa, arguably the most famous portrait in the world. Works by Poussin, Rembrandt, Titian, D�rer, Raphael, Rubens, Vel�zquez, and other artists illustrate the highlights of the period. The book itself is an interesting enough survey of some of the greatest portraits ever painted and the artists who created them. But it contains poorly reproduced plates of relatively common paintings and a conventional introductory essay, not to mention overlong annotations that tend to overtake the actual images. Still, <i>The Art of the Portrait</i> has achieved minor notoriety since being cited by David Hockney in <i>The New Yorker</i> (January 31, 2000) as supporting his theory that painters of the 16th century must have relied on optical devices such as the camera lucida to create the near-photographic perfection of the portraits. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p></p><h2>High School United States History 2013 Modern America Student Edition Grade 10/12</h2><p>High School United States History of Modern America for Grades 10-12.

The assassination of President Abraham Lincoln stunned a nation that was just emerging from the chaos and calamity of the Civil War, and the president's untimely death altered the trajectory of postwar history. But to those who knew Booth, the event was even more shocking-for no one could have imagined that this fantastically gifted actor and well-liked man could commit such an atrocity. <br><br>In <i>Fortune's Fool, Terry Alford provides the first comprehensive look at the life of an enigmatic figure whose life has been overshadowed by his final, infamous act. Tracing Booth's story from his uncertain childhood in Maryland, characterized by a difficult relationship with his famous actor father, to his successful acting career on stages across the country, Alford offers a nuanced picture of Booth as a public figure, performer, and deeply troubled man. Despite the fame and success that attended Booth's career--he was billed at one point as "the youngest star in the world"--he found himself consumed by the Confederate cause and the desire to help the South win its independence. Alford reveals the tormented path that led Booth to conclude, as the Confederacy collapsed in April 1865, that the only way to revive the South and punish the North for the war would be to murder Lincoln--whatever the cost to himself or others. The textured and compelling narrative gives new depth to the familiar events at Ford's Theatre and the aftermath that followed, culminating in Booth's capture and death at the hands of Union soldiers 150 years ago. <br><br>Based on original research into government archives, historical libraries, and family records, <i>Fortune's Foo</i><i>l offers the definitive portrait of John Wilkes Booth.</i></i></p><p><br><b>Terry Alford</b> is Professor Emeritus&nbsp;of History at Northern Virginia Community College.

As photographers, we frequently have difficulty speaking about images because, frankly, we don&#x2019;t know how to think about them. And if we don&#x2019;t know how to think about a photograph and its &#x201c;visual language&#x201d;&#x2013; how an image is constructed, how it works, and why it works&#x2013;then, when we&#x2019;re behind the camera, are we really making images that best communicate our vision, our original intent? Vision&#x2013;crucial as it is&#x2013;is not the ultimate goal of photography; expression is the goal. And to best express ourselves, it is necessary to learn and use the grammar and vocabulary of the visual language.<br> <br> <b> <i>Photographically Speaking</i> </b>is about learning photography&#x2019;s visual language to better speak to why and how a photograph succeeds, and in turn to consciously use that visual language in the creation of our own photographs, making us stronger photographers who are able to fully express and communicate our vision.

Elements are the &#x201c;words&#x201d; of the image, what we place within the frame&#x2013;lines, curves, light, color, contrast. Decisions are the choices we make in assembling those elements to best express and communicate our vision&#x2013;the use of framing, perspective, point of view, balance, focus, exposure.<br> <br>All content within the frame has meaning, and duChemin establishes that photographers must consciously and deliberately choose the elements that go within their frame and make the decisions about how that frame is constructed and presented. In the second half of the book, duChemin applies this methodology to his own craft, as he explores the visual language in 20 of his own images, discussing how the intentional choices of elements and decisions that went into their creation contribute to their success.<br></p><p>An assignment photographer specializing in humanitarian projects and world photography, David duChemin has been creating compelling stories with a camera in hand for over twenty years.

While the fighting still raged, Ryszard Kapuscinski, Poland's leading foreign correspondent, traveled to Ethiopia to seek out and interview Selassie's servants and closest associates on how the Emperor had ruled and why he fell. This "sensitive, powerful. . .history" (<i>The New York Review of Books</i>) is Kapuscinski's rendition of their accounts&#x2014;humorous, frightening, sad, groteque&#x2014;of a man living amidst nearly unimaginable pomp and luxury while his people teetered netween hunger and starvation.</p><p>Haile Selassie, His Most Puissant Majesty and Distinguished Highness the Emperor of Ethiopia, enjoyed a 44-year reign until his own army gave him the boot in 1974. In the days following the coup, the Polish journalist Ryszard Kapuscinski traveled to Ethiopia and sought out members of the imperial court for interviews. <p> His composite portrait of Selassie's crumbling imperium is an astonishing, wildly funny creation, beginning with the very first interview.

During various ceremonies, he would run away from the Emperor's lap and pee on dignitaries' shoes. The august gentlemen were not allowed to flinch or make the slightest gesture when they felt their feet getting wet. I had to walk among the dignitaries and wipe the urine from their shoes with a satin cloth. This was my job for ten years." (Well, it's a living.) </p><p> Elsewhere, the interviewees venture into tragic or grotesque or downright unbelievable terrain. Kapuscinski has shaped their testimonies into an eloquent whole, and while he never alludes to the totalitarian regime that ruled his native Poland during the same period, the analogy is impossible to ignore.</p>&#34;[The Emperor] transcends reportage, becoming a nightmare of power...

Many people today have little sense of how their lives have benefited from Christianity&#x2019;s influence, often viewing the church with hostility or resentment.Under the Influence is a topically arranged Christian history for Christians and non-Christians. Grounded in solid research and written in a popular style, this book is both a helpful apologetic tool in talking with unbelievers and a source of evidence for why Christianity deserves credit for many of the humane, social, scientific, and cultural advances in the Western world in the last 2,000 years. Photographs and timelines enhance each chapter.Some unrecognized contributions of Christianity include: * Bringing sanctity to human life by opposing the Greco-Roman practices of abortion, infanticide, child abandonment, and suicide * Raising the level of sexual morality and giving dignity to family life * Giving freedom and dignity to women * First founding hospitals in the 4th century * Originating universities and higher education * Bringing dignity and honor to labor * Spawning and developing modern science * First condemning slavery and inspiring its abolition * Producing major contributions to art, architecture, music, and literature</p><p>Alvin J.

Great learning at home and in the classroom.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman, M.A., is the author and co-author of hundreds popular storybooks and workbooks for children. Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products.

Here he discusses the seeming scientific naivet� behind the creation story, God&#x2019;s love and goodness, and humanity&#x2019;s creation, its free will, and its blessedness. Bonhoeffer also tackles difficult questions that are raised from the first book of the Bible, questions about the seemingly redundant second story of creation, about God&#x2019;s own beginning, about the source of the light that was created the first day. The author then expounds upon Adam and Eve&#x2019;s fall from grace: How could they, creatures made in God&#x2019;s image, have thought to oppose God so foully? Where did the first evil come from? How did humanity lose its right to live in paradise?<br><br>In &#x201c;Temptation,&#x201d; Bonhoeffer questions how temptation appeared in the midst of Eden&#x2019;s innocence, and he explores the very nature of evil. Bonhoeffer explains that Jesus Christ helps us to understand and conquer physical and spiritual temptation through His grace and goodness.</p><p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer was born in Breslau in 1906. The son of a famous German psychiatrist, he studied in Berlin and New York City. He left the safety of America to return to Germany and continue his public repudiation of the Nazis, which led to his arrest in 1943. Linked to the group of conspirators whose attempted assassination of Hitler failed, he was hanged in April 1945.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Rise of Silas Lapham (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>William Dean Howells' richly humorous characterization of a self-made millionaire in Boston society provides a paradigm of American culture in the Gilded Age. After establishing a fortune in the paint business, Silas Lapham moves his family from their Vermont farm to the city of Boston, where they awkwardly attempt to break into Brahmin society. Silas, greedy for wealth as well as prestige, brings his company to the brink of bankruptcy, and the family is forced to return to Vermont, financially ruined but morally renewed. As Kermit Vanderbilt points out in his introduction, the novel focuses on important themes in the American literary tradition: the efficacy of self-help and determination, the ambiguous benefits of social and economic progress, and the continual contradiction between urban and pastoral values.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><b>The Rise of Silas Lapham</b> (1885) is Howell�s best-known work, and this elegant tale of Boston society and manners is rightly regarded as a subtle classic of its time. Silas Lapham inherits his father�s paint business, from which he makes a great deal of money, and moves his family from rural Vermont to cosmopolitan Boston. Attempting to break into the city�s sophisticated society he becomes bent on the acquisition of both money and social position. Howells contrasts "old" and "new" money, presenting the representatives of both sympathetically and portraying the attempts of the self-made man to break into the world inhabited by those from "established" families with humour and delicacy.Silas Lapham is a rough-hewn entrepreneur who has made his fortune in mineral paint. Socially ambitious for their daughters, Lapham and his wife encourage the suit of Tom Corey, son of an aristocratic Boston family, whose own parents are appalled by his consorting with vulgar upstarts. But which Lapham girl does Tom really love: the pretty blonde Irene or her bookish sister Penelope? As the romantic confusion is sorted out, Lapham suffers calamities that threaten both his financial and personal integrity. His rise is ultimately a moral one. The first major American novel to centre on a businessman, The Rise of Silas Lapham (1885) explores the capitalist ethos of the American Gilded Age. It is also a brilliant novel of manners that shows the comic confrontation of old wealth and new riches.</p><h2>A Superior Death: An Anna Oigeon Mystery</h2><p>The inaccessible wreck, Kamloops, has rested at the bottom of Lake Superior for nearly seven decades, the bodies of its ill-fated crew eerily preserved in the frigid waters. But now there is an extra corpse on board -- a newly slain interloper suspiciously dressed in 1920&#39;s clothing. It is Anna Pigeon&#39;s jobas a ranger with the U.S. National Park Service to help protect wild and lonely places from civilization&#39;s corrupting touch. Now a bizarre mystery held firmly in a Great Lake&#39;s icy grip is drawing Anna into a nightmare of greed adn cold-blooded murder. And what she finds waiting beneath the surface could prove fatal.</p><p>Navada Barr is the award-winning author of seven Anna Pigeon mysteries: <i>Track of the Cat, A Superior Death, III Wind, Firestorm, Endangered Species, Blind Descent, and Liberty Falling.</i> She lives in Mississippi and was most recent a ranger on the Natchez Trace ParkwayIn her second appearance, after Track of the Cat , National Park Service ranger Anna Pigeon is posted to an island in Lake Superior, where her interest in wildlife is fully engaged by the local population of humans. Two scuba-diving tourists exploring an old, submerged wreck discover a recent addition: the body of Denny Castle, who ran a commercial diving concession in the park. This makes Anna uneasy about the mysterious disappearance of Donna Butkus, wife of fellow ranger Scotty Butkus. Hawk Bradshaw, who worked with Denny, suggests that there was a link between Denny and Donna, but Hawk is less revealing about the nature of the relationship he and his twin sister had with the dead man and the impact Denny's recent marriage (to yet another woman) had on it. The Bradshaws aren't the only reticent ones here; indeed, Barr's characters hide enough unsavory secrets to keep a soap opera humming for months. Despite the wealth of personal intrigue, FBI agent Frederic Stanton looks for a drug connection to the murder: "I'm all for drugs . . . Takes the guesswork out of law enforcement." The levelheaded Anna is again a treat as she and a couple of minor characters whose lives don't verge on melodrama keep the story from floundering on the rocks.

Whether you're a novice or several years into this fascinating sport, the Islers' knowledge and insight will speed you along your course to sailing mastery."<br> &#x2015;John Burnham, Editor of <i>Cruising World magazine</i></p><b>JJ and Peter Isler</b> have been sailing for most of their lives. JJ grew up around boats in San Diego, California, learning to sail in a little 7-foot dinghy called a Sabot. Peter started out loving powerboats and fishing (boys can be so strange!), but took up sailing after his family moved to Connecticut when he was 13 years old.<br> The Islers are well known throughout the world of sailing as top competitors and teachers. They both have taught sailing to people of all ages and experiences. Peter played an important, early role in developing US Sailing&#x2019;s educational program. He also coached at the Olympic level and helped found the American Sailing Association, which accredits sailing schools and certifies sailors and instructors.<br> Peter has twice won the America&#x2019;s Cup, serving as navigator aboard <i>Stars &amp; Stripes</i> with Dennis Conner in 1987 and 1988. An accomplished small-boat sailor, Peter was Intercollegiate Sailor of the Year while at Yale University. He was the top-ranked U.S. sailor on the professional match-racing circuit for five years and has won many of the world&#x2019;s major ocean races, including the Bermuda Race and the Transpac (where he navigated <i>Morning Glory</i> to an elapsed time record in 2005).<br> Peter has also been very active in the media. In the 1990s, he shifted his America&#x2019;s Cup energies to television, where he was a featured analyst in ESPN&#x2019;s Emmy Award&#x2013;winning Cup coverage in 1992 and 1995. More recently, he covered sailing for the Outdoor Life Network (OLN), including its coverage of the 2003 America&#x2019;s Cup. He is the author of several books on the sport and is presently Editor at Large of <i>Sailing World</i> magazine. In his spare time, Peter enjoys playing guitar and keyboard with his band, The Water Brothers.<br> JJ is the only American female (so far) to have won two Olympic medals in sailing, and she is the first female inductee in the <i>Sailing World</i> Hall of Fame. With crew member Pamela Healy, JJ won the Bronze Medal in the Women&#x2019;s 470 class in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. In the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, she and crew member Pease Glaser won the Silver. JJ is a four-time Rolex Yachtswoman of the Year (in 1986, 1991, 1997, and 2000) and has won three World Championships and numerous national titles. She was the first female to compete in a number of events on the international matchracing circuit. And in 1995 she was the tactician and starting helmsman for the <i>America3</i> Women&#x2019;s America&#x2019;s Cup team. She graduated from Yale University where she was captain of the sailing team and a collegiate All-American.</p><h2>Surgical Recall</h2><p>Written in a rapid-fire question-and-answer format, <b>Surgical Recall, 7e</b> is a popular, high-yield reference for 3rd and 4th year clerkship students performing surgical rotations.

At thirty-eight, she's childless, a recent widow, alone. She owns a successful bookstore on Seattle's Blossom Street, but despite her accomplishments, there's a feeling of emptiness.&nbsp;<br><br>On Valentine's Day, Anne Marie and several other widows get together to celebrate...a sense of hope. They each begin a list of twenty wishes&#x2014;including things they'd always wanted to do but never did.&nbsp;<br><br>Some of the items on Anne Marie's list: learning to knit, falling in love again, doing good for someone else. When she volunteers at a local school, an eight-year-old girl named Ellen enters her life. It's a relationship that becomes far more involving&#x2014;and far more important&#x2014;than Anne Marie had ever imagined.&nbsp;<br><br>As Ellen helps Anne Marie complete her list, they both learn that wishes can come true...but not necessarily in the way you expect!</p><p>Debbie Macomber is a #1 New York Times bestselling author and a leading voice in women&#x2019;s fiction worldwide.

When Robert was alive. But tonight, on the most romantic day of the year, thirty-eight-year-old Anne Marie Roche was alone. Turning over the closed sign on the door of Blossom Street Books, she glanced at the Valentine's display with its cutout hearts and pink balloons and the collection of romance novels she didn't read anymore. Then she looked outside. Streetlights flickered on as evening settled over the Seattle neighborhood.<br><br>The truth was, Anne Marie hated her life. Well, okay, <em>hate </em>was putting it too strongly. After all, she was healthy, reasonably young and reasonably attractive, financially solvent, <em>and </em>she owned the most popular bookstore in the area. But she didn't have anyone to love, anyone who loved her. She was no longer part of something larger than herself. Every morning when she woke, she found the other side of the bed empty and she didn't think she'd ever get accustomed to that desolate feeling.<br><br>Her husband had died nine months ago. So, technically, she was a widow, although she and Robert had been separated. But they saw each other regularly and were working on a reconciliation.<br><br>Then, suddenly, it was all over, all hope gone. Just when they were on the verge of reuniting, her husband had a massive heart attack. He'd collapsed at the office and died even before the paramedics could arrive.<br><br>Anne Marie's mother had warned her about the risks of marrying an older man, but fifteen years wasn't <em>that </em>much older. Robert, charismatic and handsome, had been in his mid-forties when they met. They'd been happy together, well matched in every way but one.<br><br>Anne Marie wanted a baby.<br><br>Robert hadn't.<br><br>He'd had a family&#x2014;two children&#x2014;with his first wife, Pamela, and wasn't interested in starting a second one. When she'd married him, Anne Marie had agreed to his stipulation. At the time it hadn't seemed important. She was madly in love with Robert&#x2014;and then two years ago it hit her. This longing, this need for a baby, grew more and more intense, and Robert's refusal became more adamant. His solution had been to buy her a dog she'd named Baxter. Much as she loved her Yorkie, her feelings hadn't changed. She'd still wanted a baby.<br><br>The situation wasn't helped by Melissa, Robert's twenty-four-year-old daughter, who disliked Anne Marie and always had. Over the years Anne Marie had made many attempts to ease the tension between them, all of which failed. Fortunately she had a good relationship with Brandon, Robert's son, who was five years older than his sister.<br><br>When problems arose in Anne Marie and Robert's marriage, Melissa hadn't been able to disguise her glee. Her stepdaughter seemed absolutely delighted when Robert moved out the autumn before last, seven months before his death.<br><br>Anne Marie didn't know what she'd done to warrant such passionate loathing, other than to fall in love with Melissa's father. She supposed the girl's ardent hope that her parents would one day remarry was responsible for her bitterness. Every child wanted his or her family intact. And Melissa was a young teen when Anne Marie married Robert&#x2014;a hard age made harder by the family's circumstances. Anne Marie didn't blame Robert's daughter, but his marriage to Pamela had been dead long before she entered the picture. Still, try as she might, Anne Marie had never been able to find common ground with Melissa. In fact, she hadn't heard from her since the funeral.<br><br>Anne Marie opened the shop door as Elise Beaumont approached. Elise's husband, Maverick, had recently passed away after a lengthy battle with cancer. In her mid-sixties, she was a retired librarian who'd reconnected with her husband after nearly thirty years apart, only to lose him again after less than three. She was a slight, gray-haired woman who'd become almost gaunt, but the sternness of her features was softened by the sadness in her eyes. A frequent patron of the bookstore, she and Anne Marie had become friends during the months of Maverick's decline. In many ways his death was a release, yet Anne Marie understood how difficult it was to let go of someone you loved.<br><br>"I was hoping you'd come," Anne Marie told her with a quick hug. She'd closed the store two hours early, giving Steve Handley, her usual Thursday-night assistant, a free evening for his own Valentine celebration.<br><br>Elise slipped off her coat and draped it over the back of an overstuffed chair. "I didn't think I would and then I decided that being with the other widows was exactly what I needed tonight."<br><br>The widows.<br><br>They'd met in a book group Anne Marie had organized at the store. After Robert died, she'd suggested reading Lolly Winston's <em>Good Grief, </em>a novel about a young woman adjusting to widowhood. It was through the group that Anne Marie had met Lillie Higgins and Barbie Foster. Colette Blake had joined, too. She'd been a widow who'd rented the apartment above A Good Yarn, Lydia Goetz's yarn store. Colette had married again the previous year.<br><br>Although the larger group had read and discussed other books, the widows had gravitated together and begun to meet on their own. Their sessions were often informal gatherings over coffee at the nearby French Caf� or a glass of wine upstairs at Anne Marie's.<br><br>Lillie and Barbie were a unique pair of widows, mother and daughter. They'd lost their husbands in a private plane crash three years earlier. Anne Marie remembered reading about the Learjet incident in the paper; both pilots and their two passengers had been killed in a freak accident on landing in Seattle. Lillie's husband and son-in-law were executives at a perfume company and often took business trips together.<br><br>Lillie Higgins was close to Elise's age, but that was all they shared. Actually, it was difficult to tell exactly how old Lillie was. She looked barely fifty, but with a forty-year-old daughter, she had to be in her mid-sixties. Petite and delicate, she was one of those rare women who never seemed to age. Her wardrobe consisted of ultra-expensive knits and gold jewelry. Anne Marie had the impression that if Lillie wanted, she could purchase this bookstore ten times over.<br><br>Her daughter, Barbie Foster, was a lot like her mother and aptly named, at least as far as appearances went. She had long blond hair that never seemed to get mussed, gorgeous crystal-blue eyes, a flawless figure. It was hard to believe she had eighteen-year-old twin sons who were college freshmen; Anne Marie would bet that most people assumed she was their sister rather than their mother. If Anne Marie didn't like Barbie so much, it would be easy to resent her for being so... perfect.<br><br>"Thanks for closing early tonight. I'd much rather be here than spend another evening alone," Elise said, breaking into Anne Marie's thoughts.<br><br>There was that word again.<br><br><em>Alone.</em><br><br>Despite her own misgivings about Valentine's Day, Anne Marie tried to smile. She gestured toward the rear of the store. "I've got the bubble wrap and everything set up in the back room."<br><br>The previous month, as they discussed an Elizabeth Bu-chan novel, the subject of Valentine's Day had come up. Anne Marie learned from her friends that this was perhaps the most painful holiday for widows. That was when their small group decided to plan their own celebration. Only instead of romantic love and marriage, they'd celebrate friendship. They'd defy the world's pitying glances and toast each other's past loves and future hopes.<br><br>Elise managed a quivering smile as she peered into the back of the store. "Bubble wrap?"<br><br>"I have tons," Anne Marie informed her. "You can't imagine how many shippers use it."<br><br>"But why is it on the floor?"<br><br>"Well..." It seemed silly now that Anne Marie was trying to explain. "I always have this insatiable urge to pop it, so I thought we could do it together&#x2014;by walking on it."<br><br>"You want us to step on bubble wrap?" Elise asked, sounding confused.<br><br>"Think of it as our own Valentine's dance and fireworks in one."<br><br>"But fireworks are for Independence Day or maybe New Year's."<br><br>"That's the point," Anne Marie said bracingly. "New beginnings."<br><br>"And we'll drink champagne, too?"<br><br>"You bet. I've got a couple bottles of the real stuff, Veuve Clicquot."<br><br><em>"Veuve </em>means widow, you know. The widow Clicquot's bubbly&#x2014;what else could we possibly drink?"<br><br>The door opened, and Lillie and Barbie entered in a cloud of some elegant scent. As soon as they were inside, Anne Marie locked the shop.<br><br>"Party time," Lillie said, handing Anne Marie a white box filled with pastries.<br><br>"I brought chocolate," Barbie announced, holding up a box of dark Belgian chocolates. She wore a red pantsuit with a wide black belt that emphasized her petite waist. Was there no justice in this world? The woman had the figure of a goddess and she ate <em>chocolate?</em><br><br>"I read that dark chocolate and red wine have all kinds of natural benefits," Elise said.<br><br>Anne Marie had read that, too.<br><br>Lillie shook her head in mock astonishment. "First wine and now chocolate. Life is good."<br><br>Leading the way to the back room, Anne Marie dimmed the lights in the front of the shop. Beside the champagne and flutes, she'd arranged a crystal vase of red roses; they'd been a gift from Susannah's Garden, the flower shop next door. All the retailers on Blossom Street were friends. Hearing about the small party, Alix Turner from the French Caf� had dropped off a tray of cheese, crackers and seedless green grapes, which Anne Marie had placed on her work table, now covered with a lacy cloth. Lydia had insisted they use it for their celebration. It was so beautiful it reawakened Anne Marie's desire to learn to knit.<br><br>She wished she could see her friends' gifts as more than expressions of sympathy, but her state of mind made that impossible. Still, because of the other widows, for their sake as well as her own, she was determined to try.<br><br>"This is going to be fun," Elise said, telling them why Anne Marie had spread out the bubble wrap.<br><br>"What a wonderful idea!" Barbie exclaimed.<br><br>"Shall I pour?" Anne Marie asked, ignoring the sense of oppression she couldn't seem to escape. It had been present for months and she'd thought life would be better by now. Perhaps she needed counseling. One thing was certain; she needed <em>something.</em><br><br>"By all means," Lillie said, motioning toward the champagne.<br><br>Anne Marie opened the bottle and filled the four glasses and then they toasted one another, clicking the rims of the flutes.<br><br>"To love," Elise said. "To Maverick." Her voice broke.<br><br>"To chocolate!" Barbie made a silly face, perhaps to draw attention away from Elise's tears.<br><br>"And the Widow's champagne," Lillie threw in.<br><br>Anne Marie remained silent.<br><br>Although it'd been nine months, her grief didn't seem to diminish or become any easier to bear. She worked too much, ate too little and grieved for all the might-have-beens. It was more than the fact that the man she'd loved was dead. With his death, she was forced to give up the dream of all she'd hoped her marriage would be. A true companionship&#x2014;and the foundation of a family. Even if she were to fall in love again, which seemed unlikely, a pregnancy past the age of forty was risky. The dream of having her own child had died with Robert.<br><br>The four sipped their champagne in silence, each caught up in her own memories. Anne Marie saw the sorrow on Elise's face, the contemplative look on Lillie's, Barbie's half smile.<br><br>"Will we be removing our shoes in order to pop the bubble wrap?" Lillie asked a moment later.<br><br>"Mom has this thing about walking around in stocking feet," Barbie said, glancing at her mother. "She doesn't approve."<br><br>"It just wasn't done in our household," Lillie murmured.<br><br>"There's no reason to take our shoes off," Anne Marie said. "The whole idea is to have fun. Make a bit of noise, celebrate our friendship and our memories."<br><br>"Then I say, let 'er rip," Elise said. She raised her sensibly shod foot and stomped on a bubble. A popping sound exploded in the room.<br><br>Barbie went next, her step firm. Her high heels effectively demolished a series of bubbles.<br><br><em>Pop. Pop. Pop.</em><br><br><em>Pop.</em><br><br>Lillie followed. Her movements were tentative, almost apologetic.<br><br><em>Pop.</em><br><br>Anne Marie went last. It felt... good. Really good, and the noise only added to the unexpected sense of fun and exhilaration. For the first time since the party had begun, she smiled.<br><br>By then they were all flushed with excitement and champagne. The others were laughing giddily; Anne Marie couldn't quite manage that but she could <em>almost </em>laugh. The ability to express joy had left her when Robert died. That wasn't all she'd lost. She used to sing, freely and without self-consciousness. But after Robert's funeral Anne Marie discovered she couldn't sing anymore. She just couldn't. Her throat closed up whenever she tried. What came out were strangled sounds that barely resembled music, and after a while she gave up. It'd been months since she'd even attempted a song.<br><br>The popping continued as they paraded around on the bubble wrap, pausing now and then to sip champagne. They marched with all the pomp and ceremony of soldiers in procession, saluting one another with their champagne flutes.<br><br>Thanks to her friends, Anne Marie found that her mood had begun to lift.<br><br>Soon all the bubbles were popped. Bringing their champagne, they sat in the chairs where the reader groups met and toasted each other again in the dimly lit store.<br><br>Leaning back, Anne Marie tried to relax. Despite her earlier laughter, despite spending this evening with friends, her eyes filled with tears. She blinked them away, but new tears came, and it wasn't long before Barbie noticed. Her friend placed a reassuring hand on Anne Marie's knee.<br><br>"Does it ever hurt any less?" Anne Marie asked.<br><br>Searching for a tissue in her hip pocket, she blotted her eyes. She hated breaking down like this. She wanted to explain that she'd never been a weepy or sentimental woman. All her emotions had become more intense since Robert's death.<br><br>Lillie and Barbie exchanged knowing looks. They'd been widows the longest.<br><br>"It does," Lillie promised her, growing serious, too. "But it takes time."<br><br>"I feel so alone."<br><br>"That's to be expected," Barbie said, passing her the box of chocolates. "Here, have another one. You'll feel better."<br><br>"That's what my grandmother used to say," Elise added. "Eat, and everything will seem better."<br><br>"Mine always said I'd be good as new if I did something for someone else," Lillie said. "Grams swore that showing kindness to others was the cure for any kind of unhappiness."<br><br>"Exercise helps, too," Barbie put in. "I spent many, many hours at the gym."<br><br>"Can't I just buy something?" Anne Marie asked plaintively, and hiccuped a laugh as she made the suggestion.<br><br>The others smiled.<br><br>"I wish it was that easy," Elise said in a solemn voice.<br><br></p><h2>America's Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull &amp; Bones</h2><p>"For 170 years they have met in secret.

Voltaire tells of the ludicrous adventures and reversals of fortune of the na�ve Candide, who doggedly believes that &#x201c;all is for the best&#x201d; even when faced with injustice, suffering, and despair. A satirical challenge to the empty optimism prevalent in Voltaire&#x2019;s eighteenth-century society is both controversial and entertaining, but also vitally relevant today in our world pervaded by&#x2014;as Candide would say&#x2014;&#x201c;the mania for insisting that all is well when all is by no means well.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Political satire doesn't age well, but occasionally a diatribe contains enough art and universal mirth to survive long after its timeliness has passed. <i>Candide</i> is such a book. Penned by that Renaissance man of the Enlightenment, Voltaire, <i>Candide</i> is steeped in the political and philosophical controversies of the 1750s. But for the general reader, the novel's driving principle is clear enough: the idea (endemic in Voltaire's day) that we live in the best of all possible worlds, and apparent folly, misery and strife are actually harbingers of a greater good we cannot perceive, is hogwash.<p> Telling the tale of the good-natured but star-crossed Candide (think Mr. Magoo armed with deadly force), as he travels the world struggling to be reunited with his love, Lady Cunegonde, the novel smashes such ill-conceived optimism to splinters. Candide's tutor, Dr. Pangloss, is steadfast in his philosophical good cheer, in the face of more and more fantastic misfortune; Candide's other companions always supply good sense in the nick of time. Still, as he demolishes optimism, Voltaire pays tribute to human resilience, and in doing so gives the book a pleasant indomitability common to farce. Says one character, a princess turned one-buttocked hag by unkind Fate: "I have wanted to kill myself a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our most melancholy propensities; for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away, to loathe one's very being and yet to hold it fast, to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away?"<i>--Michael Gerber</i></p><p>In this new translation of Voltaire&#x2019;s best-known work, distinguished translator Burton Raffel captures the irreverent spirit of <i>Candide and </i>renders the novel in clear, vivacious English. Stylistically superior to all predecessors, Raffel&#x2019;s version now stands as the translation of choice for twenty-first-century readers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Planetary Aspects: An Astrological Guide to Managing Your T-Square</h2><p><p>A classic back in print, <i>Planetary Aspects</i> is one that every astrologer would choose on their shortlist for their own library and a great tool for all levels of astrological practice.</p><p>This comprehensive work focuses on the most challenging dynamics of the birth chart. Originally published in 1987, it is recognized as a classic of modern astrology, and was the most highly rated book in the Astrology Book Club's nationwide survey. The author presents powerful techniques for understanding and resolving the conflicts of planetary aspects, emphasizing the potential for growth and achievement involved in stressful aspects.</p><p>The central theme of this book is the T-square configuration--a chart pattern that occurs periodically for everyone by transit, progression, or chart comparison. The T-square is a combination of planets, signs, and houses that suggests a pronounced strength or emphasis, as well as imbalance and deficiency. <i>Planetary Aspects: An Astrological Guide to Managing Your T-Square</i> is a discussion of the conflicts and harmonies of this important aspect, and a guide to understanding the crucial periods and challenges it presents.</p></p><p><b>Tracy Marks</b> is one of the most popular and original writers in modern astrology, combining her training in psychotherapy with many years of experience in astrology.

Here is a picture book designed especially for young children who are becoming sexually aware but aren't ready to learn about sexual intercourse. Written with warmth and honesty, Amazing You! presents clear and age-appropriate information about reproduction, birth, and the difference between girls' and boys' bodies. Lynne Cravath's whimsical illustrations enliven the text, making this a book that parents will gladly share with their young ones.</p></p><p>Dr. Gail Saltz lives in New York City. Lynne Cravath lives in Phoenix, Arizona.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2013;This title tackles basic body awareness and sex education. The text speaks directly to young children, differentiating between body parts that are visible most of the time and those that are kept hidden, showing the differences between girls and boys and offering a simple explanation of how babies are made without explicit reference to sex. Cravath's sunny cartoons show the various parts in a straightforward manner, though preschoolers may be confused about where the internal ones are. The text also uses terms such as "vagina" and "urinate" without actually explaining what they mean, and, curiously, the text does not discuss breasts at all, though there are side-by-side illustrations of a boy and girl in the baby, preschool, and adult stages. An author's note advises parents on the finer points of discussing these delicate issues. Though Laurie Krasny Brown's <i>What's the Big Secret?: Talking about Sex with Girls and Boys</i> (Little, Brown, 1997) remains the gold standard for sex ed for young children, this book is a friendly supplement or a nice starter for parents who aren't quite ready to go into the detail provided in Brown's book.&#x2013;<i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Maryland School for the Deaf, Columbia</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They are also, in an age when procreation is increasingly regarded as positively miraculous, trumpeted to a quite unprecedented extent.<br>BIRTH<br>Announcement of a Birth<br>This is traditionally the duty of the father, who must ring any immediate relations who were not present at the birth. Close family should be the first to hear the glad tidings, followed by prospective godparents, friends and colleagues. It is then customary to place a birth announcement in the personal column of newspapers. It is also increasingly usual to leave an announcement on the telephone answering machines of close friends, adding whether or not you are receiving calls.<br>The choice of wording for a newspaper announcement varies according to personal style, although the proper form is short and elegant.<br>PROUDPARENTS &#x2013; On 22 December, to John and Jane, a son.<br>The inclusion of the year is optional. Some couples like to add the name of the hospital, the infant&#x2019;s name and the mother&#x2019;s maiden name: this, although well intentioned, is not comme il faut. Other details such as &#x2018;little brother for Andy, Pandy and Mandy&#x2019; or &#x2018;long-awaited grandchild for Don and Doris&#x2019; are even more inappropriate and should never appear. As for the entry that once appeared in a west country local paper and which included &#x2018;thanking all concerned&#x2019;, nothing needs to be said.<br>The form for single mothers takes the same pattern:<br>PROUDPARENT &#x2013; On 30 December, to Susan, a son.<br>Smart babies are often announced, at the discretion of the social editors and often free of charge, in the Court &amp; Social pages. It has also recently become the custom, immediately on deciding a baby&#x2019;s name, to send out American-style birth announcements (see Chapter 8). These can look very smart. The same cannot be said of a card showing a jolly picture of the new family, with written details on the back. After all, as one mother said: &#x2018;I was half gaga at the time, looked absolutely at my worst and am now embarrassed about these images being in constant circulation.&#x2019;<br>Registration of Birth<br>Babies have to be legally registered. In England and Wales this has to be done within forty-two days. In Scotland the period of grace is only twenty-one days. Apart from this slight difference the procedure is largely the same throughout Great Britain. Babies are registered with their local registrar of births. If the infant is born when away from home, it is possible to declare the child locally but register it through the post to the baby&#x2019;s local area. The registering of babies by married couples is very straightforward. Either parent can do the registration, as only one signature is needed. Details of both parents are put on the certificate. Although most children automatically assume the father&#x2019;s surname, an infant can be given the mother&#x2019;s or any other of choice. The position with unmarried people is slightly more complicated. The mother always has to be present. In order for the father&#x2019;s details to be included in the birth entry, he should attend the register office with the mother and sign the register with her, or he can fill in a paternity declaration on a special form from the registrar&#x2019;s office. This needs to be witnessed by a solicitor or Commissioner for Oaths and is brought along by the woman when she attends the registration. Either the mother&#x2019;s or father&#x2019;s name can be used. In some circumstances when a father denies paternity, the mother can take him to court, where it is possible to order DNA tests to prove fatherhood and thus force him to recognise the child as his. On the other hand, if the mother does not want the father&#x2019;s name on the birth certificate a line is drawn through the space for paternal details. Alternatively a mother can also add the man&#x2019;s details later, should circumstances change, such as marriage, and therefore re-register the baby.<br>Hospital Visits<br>If you are not an immediate family member it is thoughtful, no matter how happy you are for the new mother, to delay your visit for a day or so, to give time for the immediate family to spend time with their newborn and for the mother to regain her strength. This is to ensure that she, who will undoubtedly be feeling drained by the experience of childbirth, is not overtaxed with visitors. Particularly if she has had a difficult birth, being besieged with callers can make her feel totally exhausted and confused. A mother of great experience recommends that visits from well-wishers should be no longer than twenty minutes.<br>Presents<br>As far as the newborn is concerned, it is necessary only for immediate family to bring presents, although friends may give something if they wish. This can range from a practical item for the nursery to something much more substantial and permanent, such as the two million pound trust fund that was recently settled on a very lucky three-day-old baby. Clothes, unless with prior consultation, are not recommended, as most mothers have very strong ideas about how their children are to look.<br>In all the excitement surrounding the baby, it is important to remember the star performer &#x2013; the mother. An acquaintance says: &#x2018;After a birth, women long to feel feminine again and thus welcome gifts such as delicious soaps, a beautiful nightdress and, of course, flowers.&#x2019; If sending a present &#x2013; particularly flowers &#x2013; rather than taking it in person, it is sensible to check how long the mother will be staying in hospital. Nowadays, this can be a very short time indeed. Some experts also recommend that the new baby&#x2019;s siblings are also given a small present, as their noses are often out of joint after the birth of the new arrival.<br>Letters of Congratulation<br>Friends who cannot visit should write a short letter of congratulation to the happy parents. This is always addressed to the mother and could read:<br>Dear Susan,<br>I was so thrilled to hear of the arrival of your long-awaited daughter. She will make a delightful addition to the family and help keep those boisterous boys in order.<br>With much love,<br>Freddie Well-Wisher<br>If time is short, it is just acceptable to send a postcard bearing a suitable image.<br>Single Mothers<br>Many women choose to have babies without becoming attached to a man in the conventional sense. Others have accidents. In both cases it behoves family and friends to be extra supportive, as the mother will have to cope with her new family without the traditional help of a spouse.<br>Complications<br>If there are complications it is rude to ask too many questions. If a child is born with defects, unless these abnormalities are absolutely horrendous, family and friends must behave in a positive way. If a baby is stillborn or dies shortly after birth, this awful event must be treated as a family death, with letters of condolence sent to the parents.<br>Breast-Feeding in Public<br>It is bad manners to expel any liquid from any orifice in public, and breast-feeding is no different. Nevertheless, this habit remains a very sensitive area. During the sixties and seventies, many western women asserted their right to breast-feed in public. The fact that this practice has not become widespread is largely due to the fact that many onlookers (women as well as men of different generations) find the sight embarrassing, even revolting. With this in mind, well-mannered mothers should breast-feed in private. Thoughtful hosts offer lactating visitors a quiet room where they can feed away from the general throng.<br>BAPTISM<br>Despite the secularisation of society, a surprising number of babies are baptised. Research suggests that one in four babies is christened into the Church of England alone. However, there can be problems. Although most clergy are happy to baptise babies, many harbour reservations about christening babies of families who do not attend church, claiming that nonpractising Christians are unlikely to bring their children up in a truly Christian manner. Others take the more relaxed view that by baptising an infant, the Church has acquired a new recruit.<br>Many clergymen are reluctant to give private baptisms, preferring to uphold the Church of England&#x2019;s current official line that baptism is a rebirth and a welcoming to the larger Christian communion, and thus infants should be christened during normal Sunday service in the presence of the parish&#x2019;s congregation. Others do semi-private group baptisms of several babies. Policy varies from parish to parish. However, most parents still, quite understandably, want the &#x2018;specialness&#x2019; of a private christening with friends and family rather than a public affair, and there are plenty of vicars who will oblige with a private rite. As in many aspects of contemporary religion, it is down to the discretion of your local incumbent.<br>Baptism in the Church of England<br>Within the Church of England, christenings can happen at any age, although the most frequent time is at around three or four months. Clergymen hate leaving it too late, not just for the sake of the infant&#x2019;s soul, but because the older babies are, the heavier, more wriggly and increasingly difficult they become to manoeuvre. It is usual for the ceremony to take place at the local parish church. However, if parents wish for the service to take place at another church, they must first get the permission of both ministers.<br>In the case of church-going families, the arrangement of a christening is only a formality. However, should the parents never attend church, most clergy will want some assurance that the infant, once baptised, will be brought up in the tenets of the Christian faith. The majority of parishes now insist on some sort of preparation prior to the ceremony: this can range from a single conversation about the meaning of the service to a series of classes or training sessions.<br>Normally, the local parish priest performs the service. However, some couples wish to have the ceremony conducted by a family member or friend who is in Holy Orders. In these cases it is important to remember that men of the cloth can be as territorial as those of the laity, and thus the local priest&#x2019;s permission will have to be tactfully sought. Also, should a child be christened outside its own diocese, then it is courteous to inform the bishop by letter that this is happening.<br>There are two main liturgies to choose from. The first is the traditional service from the Book of Common Prayer, which is very beautiful, places a strong emphasis on the renunciation of evil and is preferred by many to the revised texts in the Alternative Service Book. The latter is written in more modern English and is designed to present a more contemporary view of Christianity.<br>Whichever service is chosen, the central act of the ceremony remains largely constant. Parents and godparents gather around the font with the baby and are asked by the minister to affirm their belief in Christ and the renunciation of all evil. Holding the child, the priest then pours or sprinkles holy water on to the infant&#x2019;s forehead and using the child&#x2019;s new Christian names declares: &#x2018;I baptise you in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#x2019; The priest then makes the sign of the cross on the young forehead. Sometimes a lighted candle is presented to the family and specially blessed oils are used to anoint the baby. It is usual for the father to go to the vestry to register the christening. There is always a fee payable for a certificate of baptism, and should the baptism have been a private affair, then a small donation to church funds is welcomed. There is one family who, as their gesture of appreciation, organised for flowers to be delivered to the church for three Sundays after the christening of their newborn. This lovely gesture was much appreciated.<br>The dress for the christening ought to be special. Women should wear hats and men dark suits. The infant is resplendent in a white gown (this is often part of a family&#x2019;s history) that signifies purity. Sometimes a little white bonnet is also worn. Should you wish to baptise your child in an ancestral gown, it is sensible to remember that in the past babies were smaller than today. Thus your bouncing baby might be too big for the antique: certainly an early christening is advised.<br>Announcements in the Press<br>Written announcements of christenings in the Court &amp; Social pages of national newspapers are increasingly rare, although traditionally minded families like to keep up the custom. Typical wording could read:<br>The infant daughter of The Earl and Countess of Proudparentland was christened Augusta Boadicea by the Reverend Timothy Tremble at St Margaret&#x2019;s, Westminster, on Thursday 21 December. The god-parents are The Hon. Tiggy Tintangel, Mrs Peter Pork-Sausage and The Lord Tickle.<br>Note, in the case of a male infant, the names of the godfathers precede those of godmothers.<br>Catholic Baptism<br>This tends to be a rather more elaborate and lengthy affair than the Anglican rite, although in recent years it has been simplified by innovations from the Vatican. Although practices vary from parish to parish, the Roman Catholic Church, like the Church of England, now officially discourages the practice of private baptism, although in most cases the choice of baptism during mass or outside it is available (and there are still priests who will perform a private service). One godparent (or sponsor) has to be a Roman Catholic of good standing, and only his or her name is entered in the register. Sometimes there is a hymn at the beginning of the service. The parents and godparents trace the sign of the cross on the infant&#x2019;s forehead. Then follows a reading from Scripture, and a short homily and prayers. After this the infant is anointed with catechumenal oil by the priest. Parents and god-parents renounce Satan and profess their faith in God. The actual baptism is then performed. After this the child is anointed with chrism oils and wrapped in a pure white robe, and its father or godfather holds a candle lit from the Paschal candle held by the priest. This elaborate ritual concludes with the saying of the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, a blessing and the signing of the register. If the service has included an organist, there might be a fee payable to him. The priest does not charge for his services, but an offering is always appreciated. It is most important to keep the baptismal certificate, as it will be needed for future rites of religious passage, such as weddings, and for applications to Roman Catholic schools.<br>Jewish Procedures<br>Traditionally, male infants are subjected to an ancient rite called Brit Milah, at which they are circumcised at an official ceremony presided over by a mohel. This usually takes place seven days after the birth and is held at home and not at the synagogue. The rite is attended by the parents, grandparents and friends. Sandeks, the Jewish equivalent of godparents, will also be present. These may be any Jewish male, and to be asked to fulfil this role is a particular honour in the faith. The godfather holds the infant during the procedure and the father recites a special prayer. The mohel is the one who actually wields the knife, as well as reciting prayers and a blessing over a goblet of wine. The baby is then given its Hebrew name which signifies its initiation into the faith. It is considered bad luck to make any reference to the baby&#x2019;s name until after the circumcision. Female infants are spared this religious initiation and are expected only to attend the synagogue on the first Sabbath after the birth, when the father is called up or reads the Torah and the baby is given its Hebrew name. Some Reform and Liberal Jews have stripped the ritual circumcision of so...</p><h2>Don&#39;t Believe Everything You Think: The 6 Basic Mistakes We Make in Thinking</h2><p>Do you believe that you can consistently beat the stock market if you put in the effort?--that some people have extrasensory perception?--that crime and drug abuse in America are on the rise?

Featuring a personal introduction by Justice Scalia's son Father Paul Scalia, this volume will enrich every reader's understanding of the legendary justice.</b></b><br><br>Antonin Scalia reflected deeply on matters of religion and shared his insights with many audiences over the course of his remarkable career. As a Supreme Court justice for three decades, he vigorously defended the American constitutional tradition of allowing religion a prominent place in the public square. As a man of faith, he recognized the special challenges of living a distinctively religious life in modern America, and he inspired other believers to meet those challenges.<br><br> This volume contains Justice Scalia's incisive thoughts on these matters, laced with his characteristic wit. It includes outstanding speeches featured in <i>Scalia Speaks</i> and also draws from his Supreme Court opinions and his articles. In addition to the introduction by Fr. Scalia, other highlights include Fr. Scalia's beautiful homily at his father's funeral Mass and reminiscences from various friends and law clerks whose lives were influenced by Antonin Scalia's faith.</p><p>ANTONIN GREGORY SCALIA was born on March 11, 1936, in Trenton, New Jersey, the only child of Eugene and Catherine Scalia. In 1982, President Reagan nominated Scalia to join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Four years later, Reagan nominated him to the Supreme Court of the United States, to which he was confirmed by the Senate, 98- 0. Justice Scalia took his seat on the bench on September 26, 1986. As a Supreme Court justice, Scalia articulated and exercised the interpretive methods of originalism and textualism. He established himself as a forceful presence on the bench, a vivid and compelling writer, and a gregarious public presence. One of the most significant justices in the history of the Court, he served for nearly thirty years before his death on February 13, 2016. Antonin Scalia was married to Maureen for fifty- five years. Together they had nine children and dozens of grandchildren. He was a loving husband, a devoted father, a devout Catholic, and a proud American.<br><br>CHRISTOPHER J. SCALIA, the eighth of Justice Scalia's nine children and a former professor of English, works at a public relations firm near Washington, DC.

How can they reconcile reason and faith? To address these questions, Justice Scalia considered the perspectives of two great men named Thomas. Perhaps surprisingly given Scalia&#x2019;s admiration for the American founding, Thomas Jefferson served as a negative example, as he viewed belief in miracles as &#x201c;vulgar ignorance.&#x201d; Justice Scalia contrasted Jefferson with St. Thomas More, the lord high chancellor of England who was executed for respecting the Pope&#x2019;s authority to refuse King Henry VIII&#x2019;s divorce. Because he saw with the eyes of faith, this learned man of reason was regarded as a fool by his friends and even by his wife.</p><p>St. Thomas More, the patron saint of lawyers, was a hero to Justice Scalia, who delivered the following speech to religious audiences around the country.</p><p><br>The title of my talk today is &#x201c;Not to the Wise&#x2014;the Christian as Cretin.&#x201d; The second half of that title, &#x201c;The Christian as Cretin,&#x201d; is meant, of course, to be a play on words. And it is a wordplay that has some etymological basis. The English word cretin, meaning &#x201c;a person of deficient mental capacity,&#x201d; in fact derives from the French word chr�tien, meaning &#x201c;Christian,&#x201d; which was used in the Middle Ages to refer to the short, often grotesque, severely retarded people who were to be found in some remote valleys of the Alps&#x2014;perhaps the result of excessive inbreeding. These people were called chr�tiens&#x2014;Christians&#x2014;to make the point that they were human souls and not brutes.</p><p>It has often occurred to me, however, that for quite different reasons the equivalence of the words Christian and cretin makes a lot of sense. To be honest about it, that is the view of Christians&#x2014;or at least of traditional Christians&#x2014;taken by sophisticated society in modern times. One can be sophisticated and believe in God&#x2014;heck, a First Mover is at least as easy to believe in as a Big Bang triggered by nothingness. One can even be sophisticated and believe in a personal God, a benevolent Being who loves mankind, so long as that Being does not intrude too ridiculously into the world&#x2014;by working so-called miracles, for example, or by limiting human behavior in inconvenient ways. And one can even be sophisticated and believe in Jesus Christ, as having been in some sense a &#x201c;son&#x201d; of God (are we not all children of the Creator?) and as having in some sense triumphed over death (his message, after all, lives on). One can believe all that, I say, and still be considered sophisticated.</p><p>But to believe in what might be called &#x201c;traditional&#x201d; Christianity is something else. To believe, first and foremost, that Jesus Christ was God. (Why, the notion that the Creator should become a man is as unsophisticated as the notion that Zeus should become a bull.) Or to believe that he was born of a virgin. (Well, I mean, really!) That he actually, physically, rose from the grave. That he founded a church with power to bind and loose&#x2014;to pronounce, authoritatively, the will of God for mankind. That, as he taught, hardship and suffering are not to be avoided at all costs but are to be embraced and indeed even sought after&#x2014;as penance for sin, and as a means of sharing in the crucifixion of Christ. (How utterly ridiculous to forgo perfectly legitimate pleasures, and to seek discomfort! How absurd the vow of chastity and the hair shirt!) Or the belief in miracles, as at Lourdes or Fatima. Or, finally, the belief that those who love God and obey his commands will rise from the dead, in their bodies, and be happy with him forever in heaven; and that those who do not will burn eternally in hell.</p><p>Surely those who adhere to all or most of these traditional Christian beliefs are regarded, within the educated circles that you and I travel in, as&#x2014;well, simpleminded. The attitude of the wise is well reflected in the statement that appeared in a news story (not an opinion piece) in the Washington Post some years ago, stating, matter-of-factly (as though anyone of intelligence knew and agreed with it), that Christian fundamentalists were &#x201c;largely poor, uneducated and easy to command.&#x201d; The same attitude applies, of course, to traditional Catholics&#x2014;by which I mean those who do such positively peasant-like things as saying the rosary, kneeling in adoration before the Eucharist, going on pilgrimages to Lourdes or Fatima, and, worst of all, following indiscriminately (rather than in smorgasbord fashion) the teachings of the Church. Surely these people are &#x201c;uneducated and easy to command.&#x201d; Chr�tien, cretin.</p><p>Let me turn now to the first part of my title: &#x201c;Not to the Wise.&#x201d; I mean that as an allusion to the Gospel passage that you and I have heard read at Mass frequently. As recorded by St. Matthew and St. Luke, Christ said: &#x201c;I praise thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and prudent, and didst reveal them to little ones.&#x201d; The same thought appears many other times in the New Testament. St. Paul writes to the Corinthians that &#x201c;the natural man [i.e., the man of the world] does not perceive the things that are of the Spirit of God, for it is foolishness to him and he cannot understand.&#x201d; And he advises them: &#x201c;Let no one deceive himself. If any one of you thinks himself wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may come to be wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.&#x201d; In other words, St. Paul quite entirely expected&#x2014;he assumed&#x2014;that the wise of the world would regard Christians as fools. And from the beginning until now that expectation has not been disappointed.</p><p>It is interesting to read of St. Paul&#x2019;s experience in that ancient center of wisdom and intellectuality, Athens. The Acts of the Apostles record some great successes in Paul&#x2019;s preaching; Athens was not one of them. He goes to the Areopagus&#x2014;where, as the Acts contemptuously describe it, &#x201c;all the Athenians and the visitors there from abroad used to spend all their leisure telling or listening to something new.&#x201d; Sort of an open-air Donahue Show, though perhaps a bit more intellectually elevated. Anyway, Paul goes up there, and he has this really clever speech laid out, in which he says that he knows the people of Athens are very religious, and he has noticed that one of their altars is inscribed &#x201c;To the Unknown God.&#x201d; It is that God he has come to tell them about. This is a brilliant intro, and Paul gets rolling along pretty well, until he says that this God he has been talking about &#x201c;will judge the world with justice by a Man whom he has appointed, and whom he has guaranteed to all by raising him from the dead.&#x201d; Well, that breaks it. The wise men of Athens, circa a.d. 50, know just as well as the wise men of America, a.d. 2010, that people don&#x2019;t rise from the dead. As the Acts record it: &#x201c;Now when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer, but others said, &#x2018;We will hear thee again on this matter.&#x2019; &#x201d; Paul did not think the prospects of their hearing him again good enough to be worth his time. The next line of the Acts is &#x201c;So Paul went forth from among them.&#x201d;</p><p>Now let me propel you forward in time, from a.d. 50 to a.d. 1804&#x2014;just yesterday, by comparison&#x2014;to the study of another wise man, a worthy successor of those of Athens and one of our nation&#x2019;s greatest political figures, Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson is creating the work that he would call The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, known more familiarly as the Jefferson Bible. As one historian [Jaroslav Pelikan] describes the scene:</p><p>There has certainly never been a shortage of boldness in the history of biblical scholarship during the past two centuries, but for sheer audacity Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s two redactions of the Gospels stand out even in that company. It is still a bit overwhelming to contemplate the sangfroid exhibited by the third president of the United States as, razor in hand, he sat editing the Gospels during February 1804, on (as he himself says) &#x201c;2. or 3. nights only at Washington, after getting thro&#x2019; the evening task of reading the letters and papers of the day.&#x201d; He was apparently quite sure that he could tell what was genuine and what was not in the transmitted text of the New Testament.</p></p><h2>Edible Schoolyard: A Universal Idea</h2><p>One of America's most influential chefs Alice Waters created a revolution in 1971 when she introduced local organic fare at her Berkeley California restaurant Chez Panisse. Twenty-five years later she and a small group of teachers and volunteers turned over long-abandoned soil at an urban middle school in Berkeley and planted the Edible Schoolyard. The schoolyard has since grown into a universal idea of Edible Education that integrates academics with growing cooking and sharing wholesome delicious food. With inspiring images of the garden and kitchen and their young caretakers <em>Edible Schoolyard</em> is at once a visionary model for sustainable farming and childhood nutrition and a call to action for schools across the country.</p><p>Alice Waters is president of the Chez Panisse Foundation, vice president of Slow Food International and the recipient of numerous awards. She is the author of many books including the Chez Panisse Cookbooks.Grade 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;Waters is founder of The Edible Schoolyard, a gardening and cooking program on the campus of a Berkeley, CA, middle school. An organic garden on school grounds is tended and harvested by students, with hands-on ecology and nutrition lessons woven into the curriculum. The book details the history of the program while passionately touting the physical, psychological, and spiritual benefits that arise from it. Bright photographs show the engaged youngsters at work and close-ups of the lush flora and garden fauna. Extensive back matter includes the principles of "edible education," food-related writings by some of the children, recipes, and notes that provide context for the photos on earlier pages. The text is essentially a long essay by Waters, a combination of chronology mixed with emotional storytelling. A bit rambly, and not really geared toward young readers, it may capture the interest of nature-loving kids but will likely be of more interest to adults. In a way, the whole package feels like a well-produced annual report or fundraising document for the program. Perhaps the best audience for the book would be principals looking for inspiring ideas to try at their own schools. A lovely product, but with narrow appeal to young readers.&#x2014;<i>Heidi Estrin, Feldman Children's Library at Congregation B'nai Israel, Boca Raton, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Selections from minority cultures here, for instance, are the folktale of Ny Dan the Manchu Shamaness and a funeral chant of the Yi nationality collected by local researchers in the early 1980s.

The city of Boston saw perhaps the largest concentration of women artists in the country, and <i>A Studio of Her Own</i> tells the interwoven stories of 40 of them in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It explores their lives and work both individually and communally, taking particular note of the relationships they formed, which enabled many of them to excel. Along with individual portraits of the artists, the book includes discussions of such contextual issues as the importance of the Arts and Crafts movement, concerns of marriage, family and sexuality, and the role of the MFA School. <i>A Studio of Her Own</i> is the definitive work on an important moment in America's cultural and artistic history.</p><p>Erica E. Hirshler is John Moors Cabot curator of American painting at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. She is the author of &#34;Dennis Miller Bunker&#34; and a contributor to &#34;The Bostonians.&#34;Complementing a Boston Museum of Fine Arts exhibit of the same name, Hirshler's book chronicles the birth and evolution of women artists who trained or were centered in Boston. The John Moors Cabot curator of American painting at the Museum of Fine Arts, Hirshler found her niche rediscovering lesser-known artists with her previous work, Dennis Miller Bunker: American Impressionist. She hits her stride with this new study, providing a standard for regional treatments of women artists. The book not only surveys artists grouped together solely by gender or artistic medium but also establishes the intertwining and harmonious relationships among several Bostonian generations. In addition, the original research generates fresh interest in a largely forgotten or unknown aesthetic stratum of New England. Hirshler delves into challenges specific to female artists, thus marrying art history with social history and appealing to a wider audience. Abundant illustrations, artists' biographies, and extensive footnotes make this essential for academic libraries specializing in art history.

With almost everyone they know suddenly erased from the face of the earth, the girls set out for the convent where they attend school. They are abducted almost immediately and sold to a Mumbai brothel owner, beginning a hellish descent into the bowels of the sex trade.&nbsp;Halfway across the world, Washington, D.C., attorney Thomas Clarke faces his own personal and professional crisis-and makes the fateful decision to pursue a pro bono sabbatical working in India for an NGO that prosecutes the subcontinent's human traffickers. There, his conscience awakens as he sees firsthand the horrors of the trade in human flesh, and the corrupt judicial system that fosters it.

During the 2005 tsunami, sheltered Indian teenagers Ahalya and Sita are orphaned and fall through the cracks into the criminal underworld. As they struggle to comprehend their situation, attorney Thomas Clarke, halfway across the globe, faces a personal and professional crisis that sends him off to India to work as a lawyer for an international agency focused on sex trafficking. When a brothel raid nets Ahalya but not her sister, Thomas sets off on a personal quest to find the missing teenager. The slowish start is made up for with plenty of action and travel in the second half of the story, as Thomas closes in on Sita, and the traffickers do their best to keep her hidden. Clarke&#x2019;s quest requires more than a little suspension of disbelief, but it offers an insightful take on the all-too-real problems of international human trafficking. --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>United States History: Teacher Edition Beginnings to 1877 2012</h2><p>United States History: Teacher Edition Beginnings to 1877 2012</p><p></p><h2>History: From the Dawn of Civilization to the Present Day (DK Definitive Visual Encyclopedias)</h2><p><p>Explore the fascinating story of the human race and more than 6 million years of global history in this dynamic visual encyclopedia of world events.<br><br>Using a compelling narrative format, DK's&nbsp;<i>History</i>&nbsp;untangles the common threads and forces that have shaped the past and informed the present to show that ours is a history including genes and viruses - not just battles and treaties.

The author sets the history of Spanish paintings within a European context and explores Spain&#x2019;s contact with artistic centers in Italy and the Netherlands. He discusses not only Spanish artists but also such non-Spanish painters as Titian, Ruben, and Luca Giordano, who either worked in Spain or influenced other artists there. Brown also examines the collections of foreign paintings that Spanish noblemen and prelates assembled and how these collections affected the production of art and the social status of the Spanish artist. In this up-to-date and innovative analysis of two hundred years of Spanish painting, Brown describes a country that brilliantly transformed the artistic impulses it received from abroad to fit the needs of its own society.</p><p><b>Jonathan Brown</b> is Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University.

If the structure of the protocol language is available to all manufacturers so that they can produce and market compatible control devices, then it is known as an open protocol. Building Automation: System Integration with Open Protocols is the second book in a two-book series on building automation. The first book, Building Automation: Control Devices and Applications, addresses the basic functions of building systems and how devices are used to monitor and control these systems. This second book introduces the concepts of intelligent devices, automated control, and network communication using open protocols. The two primary protocols for wired networks, LonWorks� and BACnet�, are described in detail, including information about their communication methods, information architecture, configuration, operation, and troubleshooting. Building Automation: System Integration with Open Protocols provides a foundation of control concepts and network data communication in the first three chapters. After the LonWorks and BACnet sections, the final three chapters offer capstone coverage of previous chapter concepts and their relationships. The System Integration chapter includes a series of applications that illustrate the design, installation, and configuration of each protocol in various scenarios. Applications highlight the implementation differences between the protocols in different situations. The Cross-Protocol Integration chapter discusses the future of building automation, such as greater capabilities in system control and new technologies in network communication and protocol languages.</p><p>David Fisher is President of PolarSoft Inc., a Pittsburgh-based software company that specializes in BACnet� software development and consulting.

Many species have exerted enormous influence on the biosphere's character and productivity, but none has transformed the Earth in so many ways and on such a scale as <i>Homo sapiens</i>. In <i>Harvesting the Biosphere</i>, Vaclav Smil offers an interdisciplinary and quantitative account of human claims on the biosphere's stores of living matter, from prehistory to the present day. Smil examines all harvests&#x2015;from prehistoric man's hunting of megafauna to modern crop production&#x2015;and all uses of harvested biomass, including energy, food, and raw materials. Without harvesting of the biomass, Smil points out, there would be no story of human evolution and advancing civilization; but at the same time, the increasing extent and intensity of present-day biomass harvests are changing the very foundations of civilization's well-being.</p><p>In his detailed and comprehensive account, Smil presents the best possible quantifications of past and current global losses in order to assess the evolution and extent of biomass harvests. Drawing on the latest work in disciplines ranging from anthropology to environmental science, Smil offers a valuable long-term, planet-wide perspective on human-caused environmental change. </p></p><p>Vaclav Smil is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba.

Curated by the Spanish collage artist Rebeka Elizegi, the book gives space to voices from all backgrounds, origins, and artistic expressions, and shows the wide variety of perspectives that are shaping the panorama of collage today, bringing to light a parallel effervescence of female artistic initiatives around the world. From emerging names to more well-known and established ones, the artists featured here are pushing back the boundaries of art. <em>Collage by Women</em> wants to call attention to the experiences and creative processes of artists that should be on our radar through an impressive selection of manual and digital techniques, topics and aesthetic choices, accompanied by texts that provide in-depth approaches to the inspiration, influences and work trajectory of each artist.<br> Among the artists contributing to the book are Annegret Soltau, Rozenn Le Gall, Caro Mantke, Eva Eun-Sil Han, Eugenia Loli, Sarah Eisenlohr, Isabel Reitemeyer, Olivia Descampe or Linden Eller.<br></p><p>Rebeka Elizegi is an art director and graphic designer based in Barcelona, Spain, where she runs the design studio Alehop, with her partner, illustrator Victor Escandell.

Written for a generation presented with challenges of terrible proportions--the Industrial, American, and French Revolutions, to name the most obvious--Burke's <em>Reflections of the Revolution in France</em> displays an acute awareness of how high political stakes can be, as well as a keen ability to set contemporary problems within a wider context of political theory.</p><p>Born and educated in Oxford, Leslie Mitchell is also the author of Charles James Fox (1992, #25).<br>"Oxford does the student and scholarly world a service by making <em>Reflections</em> available in an affordable edition."--Barbara B.

Lyle Haskins, <em>Northeastern State University</em><p></p><br>"Burke's views are as pertinent today as they were 200 years ago. His comments and criticisms of the French Revolution can be applied to 20th century revolutions. It is interesting that his reflections are echoed by so many revisionist French Revolution historians in the past several years. This work allows students to evaluate the events of the revolution from a different perspective."--Professor Jeanne A.

He had firsthand exposure to forms of Jewish folk culture that were destroyed by the Nazis, and many of his works testify to the richness of that annihilated world. In his stories set in Poland, Singer drew upon vernacular traditions for tales imbued with a wild, sometimes mischievous, often disturbing supernaturalism that was an outgrowth of local storytelling but containing dark undercurrents born of his own concerns and obsessions. At the same time, his skeptical but never dismissive engagement with religion and spirituality&#x2014;and the opposing forces of secularism&#x2014;enabled him to take part in the creative ferment of Jewish modernism but also distance himself from its politics and literary methods.<br><br>In addition to &#x201c;Gimpel the Fool,&#x201d; this volume&#x2014;drawn from Singer&#x2019;s first four English-language collections of stories originally published in the 1950s and 1960s&#x2014;contains some of Singer&#x2019;s most beloved tales: &#x201c;The Spinoza of Market Street,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Gentleman from Cracow,&#x201d; &#x201c;Taibele and Her Demon,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Yentl the Yeshiva Boy,&#x201d; the basis of a hit Broadway play and the film&nbsp;<i>Yentl</i>.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b> is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Yet the electronic wizard, who competed fiercely with Marconi and with his one-time employer Edison, became swamped in debt, abandoned by a world he helped create, ending his days in seedy poverty, a bitter, anorexic eccentric obsessed with feeding pigeons and avoiding germs. Seifer, who teaches psychology at Community College of Rhode Island, attributes Tesla's downfall partly to his megalomaniacal, neurotic, self-destructive tendencies, partly to a quagmire of litigation and also to his Faustian pact with his ambivalent benefactor, Wall Street financier J. Pierpont Morgan, to whom he relinquished control of several patents. Morgan, suggests Seifer, stymied Tesla's visionary scheme for a global, wireless power-distribution system because, if realized, it would jeopardize electrical, lighting and telephone monopolies. Seifer provides the fullest account yet of Tesla as an entrepreneur, experimental physicist and inventor.<br> Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc. Boxed &amp; Starred Review<br><br> <b>From Library Journal:</b><br><br>Nikola Tesla is credited by many as the inventor of radio and should have received most of the credit for the development of modern electricity. Yet there is considerable confusion about his technical contributions and even more about his personal life. This book, by a professor of psychology at Bristol Community College and a member of the International Tesla Society, painstakingly documents Tesla's wide-ranging contributions. Born in Croatia, Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 and almost immediately began work on alternatives to what was then accepted as standard electrical technology. This brought him into conflict with Edison and later Westinghouse. The pattern of conflict continued for nearly 60 years, partially because Tesla was far ahead of his time, partially because he was erratic and off-beat, and partially because he was not an astute business partner. Seifer has analyzed extensive sources, many not previously used by other Tesla biographers, to provide a detailed interpretation of his life, but the fact that he also incorporates extensive handwriting analysis to arrive at several of his conclusions will certainly cause some reader concern. For larger science and biography collections.?Hilary Burton, Lawrence Livermore National Lab., Livermore, Cal.<br> Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.&nbsp;<i>--</i><br><br><b>From&nbsp;Booklist:</b> <br><br>What kind of genius can fathom the mysteries of electromagnetism but cannot keep corporate lawyers from taking him to the cleaners? Perhaps because his life did not culminate in wealth and acclaim, Nikola Tesla has largely slipped from the national memory. Seifer's biography rescues him from oblivion, bringing back to life the amazingly creative intellect that gave us fluorescent lighting, wireless communication, cheap electrical power, and the remote control. But Seifer also resurrects the wounded, self-destructive personality who never recovered from the loss of a favored older brother and who spiraled into weird obsessions, mental collapse, and poverty as he watched other men use his inventions to win fame and riches. Seifer does an admirable job of explaining his subject's technical feats and analyzing his psychological idiosyncrasies. Tinged with pathos, this meticulously researched biography deserves attention from all who would understand the human tragedies played out in the shadows of our neon culture.<br><i>Bryce Christensen</i>&nbsp;<i>--</i></p><h2>Distinction</h2><p>First Published in 1986.

Indeed, the desire and determination to modify the camera image are as old as photography itself&#x2014;only the methods have changed.</p><p>By tracing the history of manipulated photography from the earliest days of the medium to the release of Photoshop 1.0 in 1990, Mia Fineman offers a corrective to the dominant narrative of photography&#x2019;s development, in which champions of photographic &#x201c;purity,&#x201d; such as Paul Strand, Edward Weston, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, get all the glory, while devotees of manipulation, including Henry Peach Robinson, Edward Steichen, and John Heartfield, are treated as conspicuous anomalies. Among the techniques discussed on these pages&#x2014;abundantly illustrated with works from an international array of public and private collections&#x2014;are multiple exposure, combination printing, photomontage, composite portraiture, over-painting, hand coloring, and retouching. The resulting images are as diverse in style and motivation as they are in technique. Taking her argument beyond fine art into the realms of politics, journalism, fashion, entertainment, and advertising, Fineman demonstrates that the old adage &#x201c;the camera does not lie&#x201d; is one of photography&#x2019;s great fictions.</p></p><p><p><b>Mia Fineman</b> is Assistant Curator in the Department of Photographs at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. She has been a regular contributor to the New York Times, Slate, the Village Voice, and numerous other publications.</p>"A talented writer, Met assistant curator Mia Fineman traces photo 'fakery' to the dawn of the medium more than 150 years ago when artists took license for both aesthetic and commercial ends... Each chapter, as well as the 'Discussions of Individual Works,' yields pleasures and erudition, and overall, this finely curated collection is an unequivocal delight." -<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>The Fundamentals of Ethics, 2nd Edition</h2><p>In <em>The Fundamentals of Ethics,</em> Second Edition, author Russ Shafer-Landau employs a uniquely engaging writing style to introduce students to the essential ideas of moral philosophy. Offering more comprehensive coverage of the good life, normative ethics, and metaethics than any other text of its kind, this book also addresses issues that are often omitted from other texts, such as the doctrine of doing and allowing, the doctrine of double effect, ethical particularism, the desire-satisfaction theory of well-being, and moral error theory. Shafer-Landau carefully reconstructs and analyzes dozens of arguments in depth, at a level that is understandable to students with no prior philosophical background.<br> <br> <strong>NEW TO THE SECOND EDITION:</strong><br> <br> * Discussion questions at the end of every chapter provide students with immediate ways to test their understanding of the material<br> <br> * New, real-life extended examples reinforce the importance of the theories discussed in Chapters 4, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, and 19<br> <br> * Greatly expanded coverage of moral rights (in Chapter 8) and of membership in the moral community (in Chapter 9)<br> <br> * A new discussion of skepticism about morality in the Introduction<br> <br> * An <strong>Instructor's Manual and Testbank on CD</strong> offers chapter summaries, more than 100 essay questions, more than 200 multiple-choice questions, and 200 PowerPoint-based lecture slides.<br> <br> * A <strong>Companion Website at www.oup.com/us/shafer-landau</strong> contains all the material from the Instructor's Manual along with students resources including 250 multiple-choice questions, a glossary, and helpful web links. <br> <br> Ideal for courses in introductory ethics and contemporary moral problems, this book can be used as a stand-alone text or with the author's companion reader, <em>The Ethical Life: Fundamental Readings in Ethics and Moral Problems,</em> Second Edition, which offers original readings on ethical theory and contemporary moral problems.<br></p><p><br>Russ Shafer-Landau is Professor of Philosophy and Chair of the Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.<br>&#34;The book is written in a crystal-clear, accessible style that makes it an ideal choice for introductory courses in ethics. Indeed, this is one of the best textbooks on any subject I&#39;ve ever come across. The organization and flow of the presentation, both within and across chapters, is terrific.&#34;--Philip Robbins, University of Missouri &#34;I believe this to be the best such introduction available. Shafer-Landau&#39;s The Fundamentals of Ethics surpasses Rachels&#39; in several ways. First of all, Shafer-Landau&#39;s text is better organized. In short, whereas Rachels&#39; text provides a laundry list, Shafer-Landau&#39;s offers a taxonomy, one that will help students to understand the relations among the various issues. Secondly, Shafer-Landau&#39;s text is both broader, covering more issues than Rachels&#39; text, and deeper, covering those issues with more care and detail. Thirdly, I find Shafer-Landau&#39;s introduction to be more comprehensive and useful than Rachels&#39; first chapter. Fourthly, Shafer-Landau&#39;s text includes a glossary of key terms. Shafer-Landau&#39;s is surely the best introductory text in ethics available.&#34;--Eugene Marshall, Wellesley College &#34;The writing is as clear as any I&#39;ve seen in a philosophy textbook. I planned to use Rachels&#39; two books in my redesigned course until I discovered Shafer-Landau&#39;s. Fundamentals and Elements are similar books. The main advantage of the former over the latter is that Shafer-Landau addresses more arguments. Shafer-Landau is much stronger on metaethics, as is especially apparent in Chapter 21. Overall, I find the discussions in Fundamentals of Ethics to be richer and deeper than those in Rachels&#39; Elements of Moral Philosophy.&#34;--Jeffrey Brand-Ballard, George Washington University &#34;Shafer-Landau&#39;s book is top notch. I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s the clearest, most accessible introduction to ethics available. I&#39;ve already told my students that they should model their writing on Shafer-Landau&#39;s; I think that he&#39;s one of the clearest writ</p><h2>Art of Analog Layout, The</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Verbal explanations are favored over mathematical formulas, graphs are kept to a minimum, and line drawings are used in this user-friendly book.

Anna Peeters</p> <p>When Maigret got off the train at Givet station the first person he saw, right opposite his compartment, was Anna Peeters.</p> <p>It was as if she had predicted that he would stop at this precise spot on the platform! She didn&#x2019;t seem either surprised or proud of the fact. She was just as he had seen her in Paris, as she must always have been, dressed in a gunmetal suit and black shoes, wearing a hat whose shape or even colour it was impossible to remember afterwards.</p> <p>Here, in the wind that swept the platform, where only a few passengers were now walking, she looked taller, a little stouter. Her nose was red, and she was holding a handkerchief rolled up in a ball.</p> <p>&#x2018;I was sure you would come, inspector ...&#x2019;</p> <p>Was she sure of herself, or sure of him? She didn&#x2019;t smile as she greeted him. She was already asking him questions:</p> <p>&#x2018;Do you have any other luggage?&#x2019;</p> <p>No! Maigret had only his bellows case, in coarse mellowed leather, and he carried it himself, in spite of its weight.</p> <p>The only people to leave the train were third-class passengers, who had already disappeared. The girl held out her platform ticket to the ticket collector, who looked at her insistently.</p> <p>Outside, she went on without fuss:</p> <p>&#x2018;At first I thought of getting a room ready for you at home. Then I thought it through. In the end I imagine it&#x2019;s better for you to stay at a hotel. So I&#x2019;ve booked the best room at the H�tel de la Meuse.&#x2019;</p> <p>They had walked barely a hundred metres along the little streets of Givet, and already everyone was turning to look at them. Maigret walked heavily, dragging his suitcase along at his side. He tried to notice everything: the people, the houses, and particularly his companion.</p> <p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s that noise?&#x2019; he asked her, hearing a sound that he couldn&#x2019;t identify.</p> <p>&#x2018;The Meuse in spate, slapping against the piers of the bridge. Boat transport has been suspended for three weeks now.&#x2019;</p> <p>Emerging from a sidestreet, they suddenly came upon the river. It was broad. Its banks were indistinct. In places the brown waters spread into the meadows. Elsewhere, a boathouse emerged from the water.</p> <p>It held at least a hundred barges, tugs and dredgers, pressed tightly against one another, forming a huge block.</p> <p>&#x2018;Here&#x2019;s your hotel. It isn&#x2019;t very cosy. Do you want to stop and take a bath?&#x2019;</p> <p>It was baffling! Maigret couldn&#x2019;t define the sensation that he felt. Never, he was sure, had a woman ever aroused his curiosity as much as this one; she stayed calm and unsmiling, made no attempt to look pretty and sometimes dabbed her nose with her handkerchief.</p> <p>She must have been between twenty-five and thirty. A lot taller than the average, she was solidly built, with a bone structure that stripped her features of all grace.</p> <p>The clothes of a lower-middle-class woman, extremely sober. A calm, almost distinguished reserve.</p> <p>She treated him like a guest. She was at home. She thought of everything.</p> <p>&#x2018;I have no reason to take a bath.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;In that case, will you come straight to the house? Give your suitcase to the porter. Porter! Take this suitcase to room 3. The gentleman will be back shortly.&#x2019;</p> <p>And Maigret thought, as he looked at her from the corner of his eye: &#x2018;I must look like an idiot!&#x2019;</p> <p>For there was nothing of the little boy about him. Even though she wasn&#x2019;t exactly frail, he was twice as wide as she was, and his big overcoat made him look as if he was carved from stone.</p> <p>&#x2018;Aren&#x2019;t you tired?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Not at all!&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;In that case, I can already tell you the first few bits of information on the way ...&#x2019;</p> <p>She had already given him the first bits of information in Paris! One fine day when he got to his office, he had found this strange woman who had been waiting for him for two or three hours, and whom the office boy had been unable to send away.</p> <p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s personal!&#x2019; she had announced as he questioned her in front of two police inspectors.</p> <p>And once they were alone she had handed him a letter. Maigret had recognized the handwriting of one of his wife&#x2019;s cousins, who lived in Nancy.</p> <p> </p><p>My dear Maigret,</p> <p>Miss Anna Peeters has been recommended to me by my brother-in-law, who has known her for about ten years. She is a very responsible young woman, who will tell you of her misfortunes herself. Do what you can for her ...</p> <p></p> <p>&#x2018;Do you live in Nancy?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;No, in Givet!&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;But the letter ...&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;I went to Nancy on purpose, before coming to Paris. I knew my cousin knew someone important in the police force ...&#x2019;</p> <p>She wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary supplicant. She didn&#x2019;t lower her eyes. There was nothing humble about her bearing. She spoke frankly, looking straight ahead, as if to claim what was rightfully hers.</p> <p>&#x2018;If you don&#x2019;t agree to look at our case, my parents and I will be lost, and it will be the most hateful miscarriage of justice ...&#x2019;</p></p><h2>GRE Fractions, Decimals, &amp; Percents (Manhattan Prep GRE Strategy Guides)</h2><p>Manhattan Prep&#x2019;s 4th Edition GRE Strategy Guides have been redesigned with the student in mind.

An evolutionary perspective forms the foundation of the entire discussion. The book begins with the natural history of the planet, considers portions of the whole in the middle chapters, and ends with another perspective of the entire planet in the concluding chapter. Its unique organization of focusing only on several key concepts in each chapter sets it apart from other ecology texts. </p><p>Users who purchase Connect Plus receive access to the full online ebook version of the textbook.</p></p><p>Manuel C Molles Jr. is an emeritus Professor of Biology at the University of New Mexico, where he has been a member of the faculty and curator in the Museum of Southwestern Biology since 1975.

Now, six decades later and after most countries have rejected the practice, more than 70 percent of Americans, as well as 200 million people worldwide, are drinking fluoridated water. The Center for Disease Control and the American Dental Association continue to promote it--and even mandatory statewide water fluoridation--despite increasing evidence that it is not only unnecessary, but potentially hazardous to human health.</p> <p>In this timely and important book, Dr. Paul Connett, Dr. James Beck, and Dr. H. Spedding Micklem take a new look at the science behind water fluoridation and argue that just because the dental and medical establishments endorse a public health measure doesn't mean it's safe. In the case of water fluoridation, the chemicals that go into the drinking water that more than 180 million people drink each day are not even pharmaceutical grade, but rather a hazardous waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry. It is illegal to dump this waste into the sea or local surface water, and yet it is allowed in our drinking water. To make matters worse, this program receives no oversight from the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency takes no responsibility for the practice. And from an ethical standpoint, say the authors, water fluoridation is a bad medical practice: individuals are being forced to take medication without their informed consent, there is no control over the dose, and no monitoring of possible side effects.</p> <p>At once painstakingly documented and also highly readable, <em>The Case Against Fluoride </em>brings new research to light, including links between fluoride and harm to the brain, bones, and endocrine system, and argues that the evidence that fluoridation reduces tooth decay is surprisingly weak.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Paul Connett, a retired professor of environmental chemistry and toxicology at St. Lawrence University, has given more than 2,000 presentations in forty-nine states and fifty-two countries on the issue of waste management.

International law forbids dumping fluoride waste into the sea but it is accepted in American drinking water. As stated in the toothpaste disclaimer above, the FDA officially considers fluoride to be a drug. This drug has never been approved by the FDA. Contaminating drinking water with fluoride can be most charitably characterized as an experiment which violates the Nuremburg Code prohibiting experimental human treatment without informed consent. China, India, Japan and most of Europe do not fluoridate their water. Toward the end of the book the authors pull out one of my all-time favorite quotes from the late Michael Crichton. &#x2018;Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled ... The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus . . . There is no such thing as consensus science. If it&#x2019;s consensus, it isn&#x2019;t science. If it&#x2019;s science, it isn&#x2019;t consensus. Period.&#x2019; THUMBS UP.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Choice Magazine</em></strong><strong><em>-</em></strong></p> <p>Water fluoridation is a major controversy pitting prevention (dental caries) against ethics (involuntary drug exposure). Connett (emer., St. Lawrence Univ.), Beck (emer., Univ. of Calgary), and Micklem (emer., Univ. of Edinburgh) present compelling but not always convincing arguments for discontinuing fluoridation. They emphasize systemic treatment's low efficacy, alternative preventive approaches, the public's involuntary exposure, and potential toxicity. Although not uniquely American, water fluoridation is more popular in the US than in most countries. If ingestion of fluoride were very effective in preventing caries, the authors would still argue against the practice on ethical grounds. Six parts cover ethical arguments, lack of evidence of efficacy, the policy gamble, toxicity, the precautionary principle, and vested interests. Some inconsistencies are evident. The book emphasizes uncertainties in epidemiologic studies of efficacy, but deemphasizes uncertainties in toxicity reports, creating an imbalance appropriate for a polemic but not for a scientific treatise. Fluoridation advocates will interpret this as evidence that the antifluoridation point of view is exaggerated, whereas sympathetic readers will find their resolve strengthened. Alternatives such as fluoride supplements exist, but would not reach the poor populations that need them. This is a thought-provoking work for students of environmental policy and public health. <strong>Summing Up</strong>: Recommended. Lower-level undergraduates through graduate students; general readers. </p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>, Starred Review-</strong></p> <p>"On the eve of the new millennium, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), listed water fluoridation as one of the twentieth-century&#x2019;s 10 greatest public-health achievements. Yet according to the authors of this painstakingly researched expos� of fluoridation&#x2019;s overall ineffectiveness and toxicity, endorsements such as these from the CDC and other health organizations are motivated more by face-saving politics than credible research. Fluoridation advocates who have previously branded detractors as conspiracy theorists and shills for &#x201c;junk science&#x201d; will be hard pressed to debunk the hundreds of peer-reviewed studies and sound scientific reasoning presented here. In demonstrating fluoridation&#x2019;s ineffectiveness, the authors cite exhaustive evidence proving fluoride&#x2019;s only benefits are topical, as in toothbrushing, as opposed to swallowing. But the case against fluoride&#x2019;s alleged safety, even in small doses, is more alarming, with multiple studies showing fluoride&#x2019;s probable complicity in lowered intelligence scores, thyroid dysfunction, hip fractures, and the ominously rising incidence of osteosarcoma in boys. The authors&#x2019; academic, hyperbole-free writing style serves them well in marshaling a series of facts that, all by themselves, expose fluoridation as a false panacea. It remains to be seen, however, whether the public-health community will give this landmark work due credit or continue to rubber stamp an outdated policy that, like bloodletting and trepanation, properly belongs on the scrap heap of sham medical interventions<strong>."</strong></p><br><br><p><strong><em>American Academy of Environmental Medicine Newsletter</em>-</strong></p> <p>&#x201c;At once painstakingly-documented and also highly-readable, The Case Against Fluoride brings new research to light, including links between fluoride and harm to the brain, bones, and kidneys, and argues that while there is possible value in topical applications like brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste, the evidence that swallowing fluoride reduces tooth decay is surprisingly weak. The Case Against Fluoride doesn't question the good intentions of dentists who support fluoridation, but rather explores the poor science, bizarre tactics, biased reviews, and puzzling motivations of a relatively small number of influential people who continue to push this practice on a largely ill-informed public.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>"Sweden rejected fluoridation in the 1970s and, in this excellent book, these three scientists have confirmed the wisdom of that decision. Our children have not suffered greater tooth decay, as World Health Organization figures attest, and in turn our citizens have not borne the other hazards fluoride may cause. In any case, since fluoride is readily available in toothpaste, you don't have to force it on people."--<strong>Arvid Carlsson</strong>,<strong> Nobel Laureate in Medicine or Physiology (2000) and Emeritus Professor of Pharmacology, University of Gothenburg</strong></p><br><br><p>"Alfred North Whitehead said the scientific method means leaving 'options open for revision.' An ancient Roman adage says that 'whatever touches all must be approved by all.' These characterizations of science and democracy are the reasons for reading this book. Especially if you and your family are drinking administratively mandated fluoridated water."<strong>--Ralph Nader</strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"This book clearly shows that water fluoridation is poor public policy and must end. As a concerned citizen, I applaud the authors for bringing this issue to the world's attention."<strong>--Ed Asner</strong><br> </p><br><br><p>"For anyone who has ever wondered why cities add fluoride to water-and questioned whether they should. Written with clear and easy-to-read prose, and supporting citations, <em>The Case Against Fluoride</em> carefully lays out the arguments against fluoridation and reasons why it should be discontinued. The authors examine the evidence on fluoridation and conclude convincingly that it should now be considered 'harmful and ineffective.'"<strong>--Dr. Hardy Limeback, Professor and Head of Preventative Dentistry, University of Toronto</strong></p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Nursing Made Incredibly Easy!

In contrast, <i>The Good Immigrants </i>considers immigration from the perspective of Chinese elites&#x2015;intellectuals, businessmen, and students&#x2015;who gained entrance because of immigration exemptions. Exploring a century of Chinese migrations, Madeline Hsu looks at how the model minority characteristics of many Asian Americans resulted from US policies that screened for those with the highest credentials in the most employable fields, enhancing American economic competitiveness.</p><p>The earliest US immigration restrictions targeted Chinese people but exempted students as well as individuals who might extend America's influence in China. Western-educated Chinese such as Madame Chiang Kai-shek became symbols of the US impact on China, even as they patriotically advocated for China's modernization. World War II and the rise of communism transformed Chinese students abroad into refugees, and the Cold War magnified the importance of their talent and training. As a result, Congress legislated piecemeal legal measures to enable Chinese of good standing with professional skills to become citizens. Pressures mounted to reform American discriminatory immigration laws, culminating with the 1965 Immigration Act.</p><p>Filled with narratives featuring such renowned Chinese immigrants as I. M. Pei, <i>The Good Immigrants</i> examines the shifts in immigration laws and perceptions of cultural traits that enabled Asians to remain in the United States as exemplary, productive Americans.</p></p><p><p>"'America is a land of immigrants'--so true. But the state determines who it wants and doesn't want in decidedly unsentimental ways. Hsu's deeply researched and empathetically narrated history reveals how racial thinking, economic need, and international politics transformed the Chinese from being mostly undesirable to selectively welcomed and celebrated. This is an important study of personal experiences and policy in Cold War America."<b>--Gordon H. Chang, Stanford University</b></p><p>"How did the 'yellow peril' become the 'model minority'? Hsu's compelling book demonstrates that the admission of Asian scholars and businessmen to the United States set a pattern of valuing Asian newcomers with economically advantageous skills--a pattern that still shapes immigration and assimilation today. Bringing together legal and social history and biography to explore racial categorization, discrimination, and global economics, this meticulously researched book is essential to scholars and students of American policy debates."<b>--Alan M. Kraut, American University</b></p><p>"<i>The Good Immigrants</i> is an impeccably researched and poignant history of Chinese students and intellectuals in the United States. Exceptional in their legal status, they were nonetheless buffeted by the overarching politics of U.S.-China relations. Hsu places into historical context such figures as Madame Chiang Kai-shek, I. M. Pei, Chen-Ning Yang, and many others who, as a group, constituted the bridge between the 'yellow peril' and 'model minority.'"<b>--Mae Ngai, Columbia University</b></p><p>"<i>The Good Immigrants</i> is a critically important book that analyzes U.S. immigration policy from a wider and deeper perspective. While other works have studied why the United States enacted exclusionary race-based immigration laws, Hsu focuses on the exceptions--the relatively well-to-do Chinese who entered the United States under an exempt status as merchants, diplomats, and students. Hsu looks at the opening of American society, rather than the closing of it."<b>--Naoko Shibusawa, Brown University</b></p><p>"In <i>The Good Immigrants</i>, Hsu's exhaustive research and incisive scholarship break new ground. Probing American political narratives from the nineteenth century to the Cold War period and modern times, Hsu uncovers how certain machinations engineered immigration policy and in the process reconfigured the image of Chinese migrants into today's 'model minority.'"<b>--Helen Zia, author of <i>Asian American Dreams: The Emergence of an American People</i></b></p><b>Madeline Y.

But the elder was an especially superb horseman, and he became the successor to the empire and ruled the kingdom with such justice that he was beloved by all the people of his realm. His name was Shahryar, and he appointed his younger brother, Shah Zaman, king of Samarcan. In the years that followed, each brother was content to remain in his own kingdom, and each ruled with such equity and fairness that their subjects were extremely happy. Everything continued like this for twenty years, but at the end of that time, Shahryar yearned to see his younger brother once more before he died.</p><p>So he asked his vizier whether he thought it would be a good idea to visit his brother, but the minister found such an undertaking inadvisable and recommended that he write his brother a letter of invitation and send him gifts under the vizier&#x2019;s charge. Therefore, the king immediately ordered generous gifts to be prepared, such as horses that had saddles lined with gold and jewels, mamelukes, beautiful maidens, high-breasted virgins, and splendid and expensive cloth. He then wrote a letter to Shah Zaman expressing his strong desire to see him, and he ended it with these words: &#x201c;I, therefore, hope that my beloved brother will honor me with his visit, and I am sending my vizier to make arrangements for the journey. My one and only desire is to see you before I die. If you refuse my request, I shall not survive the blow. May peace be with you!&#x201d; Then King Shahryar sealed the letter, gave it to the vizier, and urged him to do his utmost to return as soon as possible.</p><p>&#x201c;Your wish is my command,&#x201d; said the vizier, who began making all the preparations without delay. All this work occupied him three days, and on the dawn of the fourth he took leave of his king and journeyed over hills, deserts, and pleasant valleys without stopping night or day. Of course, whenever he entered a realm whose lord was under the rule of King Shahryar, he would be greeted with magnificent gifts and all kinds of fair and rare presents, and he would be obliged to stay there for three days, the customary term for the ritual to honor guests. And when he left on the fourth, he would be honorably escorted for one whole day to speed him on his way.</p><p>As soon as the vizier drew near Shah Zaman&#x2019;s court in Samarcan, he sent one of his high officials ahead to announce his arrival. This courier presented himself before the king, kissed the ground, and delivered his message. Thereupon, the king commanded various nobles and lords of his realm to go forth and meet his brother&#x2019;s vizier a good day&#x2019;s journey from his court. After they encountered him, they greeted him respectfully and formed an escort party. When the vizier entered the city, he proceeded straight to the palace, where he kissed the ground and prayed for the king&#x2019;s health and happiness and for victory over his enemies. Then he informed the king that his brother was yearning to see him and presented the letter, which Shah Zaman took from his hand and read. When the king fully comprehended its import, he said, &#x201c;I cannot refuse the wishes of my brother. However, we shall not depart until we have honored my brother&#x2019;s vizier with three days of hospitality.&#x201d;</p><p>Shah Zaman assigned suitable quarters in the palace for the minister, and he ordered tents pitched for the troops and gave them rations of meat, drink, and other necessities. On the fourth day he prepared himself for the trip, gathered together sumptuous presents befitting his elder brother&#x2019;s majesty, and appointed his chief vizier to be viceroy of the land during his absence. Then he ordered his tents, camels, and mules to be brought forth, and he set up camp with their bales and loads, attendants and guards within sight of the city in order to set out early the next morning for his brother&#x2019;s capital.</p><p>It so happened, however, that in the middle of the night he suddenly remembered he had forgotten a gift in his palace that he wanted to take to his brother. So he returned alone and entered his private chambers, where he found the queen, his wife, asleep on his own couch, and in her arms she held a black cook with crude features, smeared with kitchen grease and grime. When he saw this, the world turned dark before his eyes, and he said, &#x201c;If this is what happens while I am still within sight of the city, what will this damned whore do during my long absence at my brother&#x2019;s court?&#x201d;</p><p>So he drew his scimitar, cut the two in four pieces with a single blow, and left them on the couch. Soon thereafter he returned to his camp without letting anyone know what had happened. Then he gave orders for immediate departure and set out on his trip. Nevertheless, he could not help thinking about his wife&#x2019;s betrayal, and he kept saying to himself over and over, &#x201c;How could she have done this to me? How could she have brought about her own death?&#x201d; until excessive grief seized him. His color changed to yellow, his body grew weak, and he appeared to be on the verge of death. So the vizier had to shorten the stages of the journey and remain longer at the watering places in order to take care of the king.</p><p>Now, when Shah Zaman finally approached his brother&#x2019;s capital, he sent messengers to announce his arrival, and Shahryar came forth to meet him with the viziers, emirs, lords, and nobles of his realm. After saluting him, he was overcome with joy and ordered the city to be decorated in his honor. At the same time, however, Shahryar could not help but see how poor his brother&#x2019;s health was, and he asked him what had happened.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s due to the long, hard journey,&#x201d; replied Shah Zaman, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;ll need some care, for I&#x2019;ve suffered from the change of water and air. But Allah be praised for reuniting me with my beloved brother!&#x201d;</p><p>Then the two entered the capital in all honor, and Shahryar lodged his brother in his palace overlooking the garden. After some time had passed, King Shahryar noticed that his brother&#x2019;s condition was still unchanged, and he attributed it to his separation from his country. So he let him do as he pleased and asked him no questions until one day when he said, &#x201c;My brother, I can&#x2019;t help noticing that you&#x2019;ve grown weaker and paler than you were before.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sick in my heart,&#x201d; he replied, but he would not tell Shahryar about his wife and all that he had seen.</p><p>Thereupon Shahryar summoned doctors and surgeons and asked them to treat his brother to the best of their ability, which they did for a whole month, but their potions had no effect, for he dwelled upon his wife&#x2019;s treachery. Indeed, he became more and more despondent, and even the use of leeches failed to change his mood.</p><p>One day his elder brother said to him, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided to go on a hunting expedition. Perhaps you&#x2019;d feel better if you joined me.&#x201d;</p><p>However, Shah Zaman declined and said, &#x201c;I am not in the mood for anything like this, and I beseech you to let me stay quietly in the palace, for I can&#x2019;t seem to get over this sickness.&#x201d;</p><p>So, King Shah Zaman spent the night in the palace by himself. The next morning, after his brother had departed, he left his room and sat down at one of the lattice windows overlooking the garden. There he rested awhile and became steeped in sad thoughts about his wife&#x2019;s betrayal, occasionally uttering sighs of grief. Now, as he was moaning and torturing himself, a secret door to the garden swung open, and out came twenty slave girls surrounding his brother&#x2019;s wife, who was marvelously beautiful and moved about with the grace of a gazelle in search of a cool stream. Shah Zaman drew back from the window, but he kept the group in sight from a place where they could not spot him, even though they walked under the very window where he had stationed himself. As they advanced into the garden, they came to a jetting fountain amidst a great basin of water. Then they stripped off their clothes, and Shah Zaman suddenly realized that ten of them were women, concubines of the king, and the other ten were white slaves. After they had all paired off, the queen was left alone, but she soon cried out in a loud voice, &#x201c;Come to me right now, my lord Saeed!&#x201d; and all of a sudden a big slobbering blackamoor with rolling eyes leapt from one of the trees. It was truly a hideous sight. He rushed up to her and threw his arms around her neck, while she embraced him just as warmly. Then he mounted her, and winding his legs around hers, as a button loop clasps a button, he tossed her to the ground and enjoyed her. The other slaves did the same with the girls until they had all satisfied their passions, and they did not stop kissing, coupling, and carousing until the day began to wane. When the mamelukes rose from the bosoms of the maidens and the blackamoor slave let go of the queen, the men resumed their disguises, and all except the Negro, who climbed up the tree, left the garden via the secret door and reentered the palace.</p><p>Now, after Shah Zaman had witnessed this spectacle, he said to himself, &#x201c;By Allah, my misfortune is nothing compared to my brother&#x2019;s! Though he may be a greater king among kings than I am, he doesn&#x2019;t even realize that this kind of perfidious behavior is going on in his very own palace, and his wife is in love with the filthiest of filthy slaves. This only proves that all women will make cuckolds out of their husbands when given the chance. Well, then, let the curse of Allah fall upon one and all and upon the fools who need the support of their wives or who place the reins of conduct in their hands!&#x201d; So, he cast aside his melancholy and no longer had regrets about what he had done. Moreover, he constantly repeated his words to himself to minimize his sorrow and added, &#x201c;No man in this world is safe from the malice of women!&#x201d;</p><p>When suppertime arrived, the servants brought him the trays, and he ate with a voracious appetite, for he had refrained from eating a long time, no matter how delicious the food. Now he was able once again to give grateful thanks to Almighty Allah for the meal and for restoring his appetite, and he spent a most restful night, savoring the sweet food of sleep. The next day he ate his breakfast with a hearty appetite and began to regain his health and strength and was in excellent condition by the time his brother came back from the hunt ten days later. When Shah Zaman rode out to meet him, King Shahryar looked at him and was astonished by the remarkable change in his brother&#x2019;s appearance, but Shah Zaman did not say or disclose a thing to him. Instead, the two just embraced, exchanged greetings, and rode into the city.</p><p>Later when they were seated at their ease in the palace, the servants brought them food, and they ate to their hearts&#x2019; content. After the meal was removed and they had washed their hands, King Shahryar turned to his brother and said, &#x201c;I am astonished by the change in your condition. I had hoped to take you with me on the hunt, but I realized that your mind was sorely troubled by something, and you looked so pale and sickly. But now&#x2014;glory be to God!&#x2014;your natural color has returned to your face, and you&#x2019;re in fine shape. I had believed that your sickness was due to the separation from your family, friends, and country, so I had refrained from bothering you with probing questions. But now I beseech you to explain the cause of your troubles and the reason for your recovery to such good health.&#x201d;</p><p>When Shah Zaman heard this, he bowed his head toward the ground, and after a while he raised it and said, &#x201c;I shall tell you what caused my troubles and bad health, but you must pardon me if I don&#x2019;t tell you the reason for my complete recovery. Indeed, I beg you not to force me to explain everything that has happened.&#x201d;</p><p>Shahryar was much surprised by these words and replied, &#x201c;Let me hear first what caused you to become so sick and pale.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well then,&#x201d; began Shah Zaman, &#x201c;it was like this. When you sent the vizier with your invitation, I made all sorts of preparations for three days and camped before my city to begin the journey early the next day. But that night I remembered that I had left a string of jewels in the palace that I intended to give to you as a gift. I returned for it alone and found my wife on my couch in the arms of a hideous black cook. So I slew the two and came to you. However, I could not help grieving about this affair and regretting what I had done. That&#x2019;s why I lost my health and became weak. But you must excuse me if I refuse to tell you how I managed to regain my health.&#x201d;</p><p>Shahryar shook his head, completely astonished, and with the fire of wrath flaming in his heart, he cried, &#x201c;Indeed, the malice of woman is mighty! My brother, you&#x2019;ve escaped many an evil deed by putting your wife to death, and your rage and grief are quite understandable and excusable, especially since you had never suffered anything as terrible as this before. By Allah, had this been me, I would not have been satisfied until I had slain a thousand women and had gone mad! But praise be to Allah, who has eased your tribulations, and now you must tell me how you regained your health so suddenly, and you must explain to me why you are being so secretive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh brother, again I beg you to excuse me for refusing to talk about this!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I insist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that my story may cause you more anger and sorrow than I myself have suffered.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s even a better reason for telling me the whole story,&#x201d; said Shahryar, &#x201c;and in the name of Allah, I command you not to keep anything back from me!&#x201d;</p><p>Thereupon Shah Zaman told him all he had seen from beginning to end, and he concluded his story by saying, &#x201c;When I saw your misfortune, and your wife&#x2019;s betrayal, my own sorrow seemed slight in comparison, and I became sober and sound again. So, discarding melancholy and despondency, I was able to eat, drink, and sleep, and thus I quickly regained my health and strength. This is the truth and the whole truth.&#x201d;</p><p>After King Shahryar heard this tale, he became so furious that it seemed his rage might consume him. However, he quickly recovered his composure and said, &#x201c;My brother, I don&#x2019;t mean to imply that you have lied to me, but I can&#x2019;t believe your story until I see everything with my own eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you want to witness your misfortune,&#x201d; Shah Zaman responded, &#x201c;rise at once and get ready for another hunting expedition. Then hide yourself with me, and you&#x2019;ll see everything with your own eyes and learn the truth.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2019</h2><p><b>An eclectic collection of fiction, essays, poetry, and graphic work selected by high school students with the help of <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Edan Lepucki.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Over the past year, fifteen Bay Area high school students have gathered each week in the basement of an independent publishing house to pore over online and print literary journals, magazines, books, plays, and graphic novels.

Herriot's last memoir, <i>Every Living Thing</i> is a truly heartwarming read, burstingly full of his deep joy in life, sense of humor, and appreciation of the world around him.</p></p><p><p><b>James Herriot</b> (1916-1995) was the bestselling author of memoirs including <i>All Creatures Great and Small</i>, <i>All Things Bright and Beautiful</i>, <i>All Things Wise and Wonderful</i>, and <i>The Lord God Made Them All</i>. At age 23, Herriot qualified for veterinary practice with the Glasgow Veterinary College, and moved to the town of Thirsk in Yorkshire to work in a rural practice. He would live in, work in, and write about the region for the rest of his life. Though he dreamed for years of writing a book, his veterinary work and his family kept him busy, and he did not start writing until the age of 50. In 1979, he was awarded the title Order of the British Empire (OBE). His veterinary practice in Yorkshire, England, is now tended by his son, Jim Wight.</p>With this collection of short stories, the listener can enjoy anecdotes about Herriot&#39;s life as a veterinarian in Yorkshire, England. Christopher Timothy characterizes Herriot--a hard-working veterinarian dedi-cated to his work--with an amiable tone. His voice shows genuine concern when telling of a particularly difficult case and elation when a treatment is successful. The program also has a lighter side, and Timothy&#39;s straight-faced tone complements the subtle humor. The unique character of the Yorkshire countryside is of great importance to the success of the program; Timothy adeptly creates the accents of the Yorkshire villagers and farmers. His award-winning talents and experience portraying James Herriot for British television make his performance thoroughly captivating. M.P.T.

Considered by James to be his most finely constructed novel, <i>The Ambassadors</i> (1903) recounts the attempts of a conscientious American to convince the son of a friend to return home from Paris-and in doing so plays the charm of the Old World against the provincialism of the New. In <i>The Golden Bowl</i> (1904), an American woman marries an Italian prince while her father unknowingly marries the prince's former mistress; James underscores both the fragility and strength of human ties and further develops what he once called the "complex fate, being an American." Originally written for the stage but never produced, James reworked <i>The Outcry</i> (1911) into a highly successful comic novel of social manners that also deals with the ethics of art collecting. Included as an appendix is "The Married Son," the chapter James contributed to <i>The Whole Family</i> (1908), a multi-author novel conceived by William Dean Howells and portraying a dysfunctional family whose struggles mirror the frustrated collaborative efforts of the book's twelve contributors.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

In New Orleans in 1937, a man and a woman embark on a headlong flight into the wilderness of illicit passion, fleeing her husband and the temptations of respectability. In Mississippi ten years earlier, a convict sets forth across a flooded river, risking his own chance at freedom to rescue a pregnant woman. From these separate stories Faulkner composes a symphony of deliverance and damnation, survival and self-sacrifice, a novel in which elemental danger is juxtaposed with fatal injuries of the spirit. <i>The Wild Palms</i> is grandly inventive, heart-stopping in its prose, and suffused on every page with the physical presence of the country that Faulkner made his own.</p><p><b>William Faulkner</b>, one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897. He published his first book,&nbsp;<i>The Marble Faun</i>, in 1924, but it is as a literary chronicler of life in the Deep South&#x2014;particularly in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, the setting for several of his novels&#x2014;that he is most highly regarded. In such novels as<i>&nbsp;The Sound and the Fury</i>,&nbsp;<i>As I Lay Dying</i>,&nbsp;<i>Light in August</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>&nbsp;he explored the full range of post&#x2013;Civil War Southern life, focusing both on the personal histories of his characters and on the moral uncertainties of an increasingly dissolute society. In combining the use of symbolism with a stream-of-consciousness technique, he created a new approach to fiction writing. In 1949 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. William Faulkner died in Byhalia, Mississippi, on July 6, 1962.&#34;There is no writer living who can play upon a scene the rich and Rembrandtesque flame that Faulkner commands&#34; * Evening Standard * &#34;His prose style is all his own, often sensuously alert, evocative, graceful&#34; * Daily Telegraph * &#34;Lays to rest any doubts that Faulkner could write a powerful love story&#34; * Washington Post * &#34;There is an extraordinary vigor and power in his writing, a feverish urge toward description in which words combine in a dense web of meaning&#34; * Chicago Tribune *</p><h2>Book Yourself Solid: The Fastest, Easiest, and Most Reliable System for Getting More Clients Than You Can Handle Even if You Hate Marketing and Selling</h2><p><i>Book Yourself Solid-</i>now in paperback-is a complete instructional guide for startingn and growing a successful service business.

Odd runes marked its forehead, carved into the yellowed bone and filled with black ink. Its thick bottom jaw supported a row of conical fangs, long and sharp like the teeth of a crocodile. The skull sat on top of an old stop sign. Someone had painted the surface of the octagon white and written keep out across it in large jagged letters. A reddish-brown splatter stained the bottom edge, looking suspiciously like dried blood. I leaned closer. Yep, blood. Some hair, too. Human hair.<br><br>Curran frowned at the sign.

But instead of the usual simple square or rectangular box of most post-Shift buildings, this house had all the pre-Shift bells and whistles of a modern prairie home: rows of big windows, sweeping horizontal lines, and a spacious layout. Except prairie-style homes usually had long flat roofs and little ornamentation, while this place sported pitched roofs with elaborate carved gables, beautiful bargeboards, and ornate wooden windows.<br><br>"It's like someone took a Russian log cabin and a pre-Shift contemporary house, stuck them into a blender, and dumped it over there."<br><br>Curran frowned. "It's his . . . What do you call it? Terem."<br><br>"A terem is where Russian princesses lived."<br><br>"Exactly."<br><br>Between us and the house lay a field of black dirt. It looked soft and powdery, like potting soil or a freshly plowed field. A path of rickety old boards, half rotten and splitting, curved across the field to the front door. I didn't have a good feeling about that dirt.<br><br>We'd tried to circle the house and ran into a thick, thorn-studded natural fence formed by wild rosebushes, blackberry brambles, and trees. The fence was twelve feet tall and when Curran tried to jump high enough to see over it, the thorny vines snapped out like lassos and made a heroic effort to pull him in. After I helped him pick the needles out of his hands, we decided a frontal assault was the better option.<br><br>"No animal tracks on the dirt," I said.<br><br>"No animal scents either," Curran said. "There are scent trails all around us through the woods, but none here."<br><br>"That's why he has giant windows and no grates on them. Nothing can get close to the house."<br><br>"It's that, or he doesn't care. Why the hell doesn't he answer his phone?"<br><br>Who knew why the priest of the god of All Evil and Darkness did anything?<br><br>I picked up a small rock, tossed it into the dirt, and braced myself. Nothing. No toothy jaws exploded through the soil, no magic fire, no earth-shattering kaboom. The rock just sat there.<br><br>We could come back later, when the magic was down. That would be the sensible thing to do. However, we had driven ten miles through lousy traffic in the punishing heat of Georgia's summer and then hiked another mile through the woods to get here, and our deadline was fast approaching. One way or another, I was getting into that house.<br><br>I put my foot onto the first board. It sank a little under my weight, but held. Step. Another step. Still holding.<br><br>I tiptoed across the boards, Curran right behind me. Think sneaky thoughts.<br><br>The dark soil shivered.<br><br>Two more steps.<br><br>A mound formed to the right of us, the dirt shifting like waves of some jet-black sea.<br><br>Uh-oh.<br><br>"To the right," I murmured.<br><br>"I see it."<br><br>Long serpentine bone spines pierced the mound and slid through the soil toward us, like fins of a sea serpent gliding under the surface of a midnight-black, powdery ocean.<br><br>We sprinted to the door.<br><br>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a cloud of loose soil burst to the left. A black scorpion the size of a pony shot out and scrambled after us.<br><br>If we killed his pet scorpion, we'd never hear the end of it.<br><br>I ran up the porch and pounded on the door. "Roman!"<br><br>Behind me the bone spines whipped out of the soil. What I'd thought were fins turned into a cluster of tentacles, each consisting of bone segments held together by remnants of cartilage and dried, ropy connective tissue. The tentacles snapped, grabbing Curran. He locked his hands on the bones and strained, pulling them apart. Bone crunched, connective tissue tore, and the left tentacle flailed, half of it on the ground.<br><br>"Roman!" Damn it all to hell.<br><br>A bone tentacle grabbed me and yanked me back and up, dangling me six feet off the ground. The scorpion dashed forward, its barb poised for the kill.<br><br>The door swung open, revealing Roman. He wore a T-shirt and plaid pajama bottoms, and his dark hair, shaved on the sides into a long horselike mane, stuck out on the left side of his head. He looked like he'd been sleeping.<br><br>"What's all this?"<br><br>Everything stopped.<br><br>Roman squinted at me. "What are you guys doing here?"<br><br>"We had to come here because you don't answer your damn phone." Curran's voice had that icy quality that said his patience was at an end.<br><br>"I didn't answer it because I unplugged it."<br><br>Roman waved his hand. The scorpion retreated. The tentacles gently set me down and slithered back into the ground.<br><br>"You would unplug yours too if you were related to my family. My parents are fighting again and they're trying to make me choose sides. I told them they could talk to me when they start acting like responsible adults."<br><br>Fat chance of that. Roman's father, Grigorii, was the head black volhv in the city. His mother, Evdokia, was one-third of the Witch Oracle. When they had fights, things didn't boil over, they exploded. Literally.<br><br>"So far I've avoided both of them, so I'm enjoying the peace and quiet. Come in."<br><br>He held the door open. I walked past him into a large living room. Golden wooden floors, huge fireplace, thirty-foot ceilings, and soft furniture. Bookshelves lined the far wall, crammed to the brink. The place looked downright cozy.<br><br>Curran walked in behind me and took in the living room. His thick eyebrows rose.<br><br>"What?" Roman asked.<br><br>"No altar?" Curran asked. "No bloody knives and frightened virgins?"<br><br>"No sacrificial pit ringed with skulls?" I asked.<br><br>"Ha. Ha." Roman rolled his eyes. "Never heard that one before. I keep the virgins chained up in the basement. Do you want some coffee?"<br><br>I shook my head.<br><br>"Yes," Curran said.<br><br>"Black?"<br><br>"No, put cream in it."<br><br>"Good man. Only two kinds of people drink their coffee black: cops and serial killers. Sit, sit."<br><br>I sat on the sofa and almost sank into it. I'd need help getting up. Curran sprawled next to me.<br><br>"This is nice," he said.<br><br>"Mm-hm."<br><br>"We should get one for the living room."<br><br>"We'd get blood on it."<br><br>Curran shrugged. "So?"<br><br>Roman appeared with two mugs, one pitch-black and the other clearly half-filled with cream. He gave the lighter mug to Curran.<br><br>"Drinking yours black, I see," I told him.<br><br>He shrugged and sat on the couch. "Eh . . . goes with the job. So what can I do for you?"<br><br>"We're getting married," I said.<br><br>"I know. Congratulations. On Ivan Kupala night. I don't know if that's good or bad, but it's brave."<br><br>Ivan Kupala night was the time of wild magic in Slavic folklore. The ancient Russians believed that on that date the boundaries between the worlds blurred. In our case, it meant a really strong magic wave. Odd things happened on Ivan Kupala night. Given a choice, I would've picked a different day, but Curran had set the date. To him it was the last day of werewolf summer, a shapeshifter holiday and a perfect day for our wedding. I told him I would marry him, and if he wanted to get married on Ivan Kupala night, then we'd get married on Ivan Kupala night. After moving the date a dozen times, that was the least I could do.<br><br>"So did you come to invite me?" Roman asked.<br><br>"Yes," Curran said. "We'd like you to officiate."<br><br>"I'm sorry?"<br><br>"We'd like you to marry us," I said.<br><br>Roman's eyes went wide. He pointed to himself. "Me?"<br><br>"Yes," Curran said.<br><br>"Marry you?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"You do know what I do, right?"<br><br>"Yes," I said. "You're Chernobog's priest."<br><br>"Chernobog" literally meant Black God, who was also known by other fun names like Black Serpent, Lord of Darkness, God of freezing cold, destruction, evil, and death. Some ancient Slavs divided their pantheon into opposing forces of light and dark. These forces existed in a balance, and according to that view, Chernobog was a necessary evil. Somebody had to be his priest, and Roman had ended up with the job. According to him, it was the family business.<br><br>Roman leaned forward, his dark eyes intense. "You sure about this?"<br><br>"Yes," Curran said.<br><br>"Not going to change your mind?"<br><br>What was it with the twenty questions? "Will you do it or not?"<br><br>"Of course I'll do it." Roman jumped off the couch. "Ha! Nobody ever asks me to marry them. They always go to Nikolai, my cousin-Vasiliy's oldest son."<br><br>Roman had a vast family tree, but I remembered Vasiliy, his uncle. Vasiliy was a priest of Belobog, Chernobog's brother and exact opposite. He was also very proud of his children, especially Nikolai, and bragged about them every chance he got.<br><br>Roman ducked behind the couch and emerged with a phone.<br><br>"When some supernatural filth tries to carry off the children, call Roman so he can wade through blood and sewage to rescue them, but when it's something nice like a wedding or a naming, oh no, we can't have Chernobog's volhv involved. It's bad luck. Get Nikolai. When he finds out who I'm going to marry, he'll have an aneurysm. His head will explode. It's good that he's a doctor, maybe he can treat himself."<br><br>He plugged the phone into the outlet.<br><br>It rang.<br><br>Roman stared at it as if it were a viper.<br><br>The phone rang again.<br><br>He unplugged it. "There."<br><br>"It can't be that bad," I told him.<br><br>"Oh, it's bad." Roman nodded. "My dad refused to help my second sister buy a house, because he doesn't like her boyfriend. My mother called him and it went badly. She cursed him. Every time he urinates, the stream arches up and over."<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Curran winced.<br><br>"You hungry? Do you want something to eat?" Roman wagged his eyebrows. "I have smoked brisket."<br><br>My fianc&#x17d; leaned forward, suddenly interested. "Moist or dry?"<br><br>"Moist. What am I, a heathen?"<br><br>Technically, he was a heathen.<br><br>"We can't," I told him. "We have to leave. We have Conclave tonight."<br><br>"I didn't know you still go to that," Roman said.<br><br>"Ghastek outed her," Curran said.<br><br>The Conclave began as a monthly meeting between the People and the Pack. As the two largest supernatural factions in the city, they often came into conflict, and at some point it was decided that talking and resolving small problems was preferable to being on the brink of a bloodbath every five minutes. Over the years, the Conclave evolved into a meeting where the powerful of Atlanta came together to discuss business. We had attended plenty of Conclaves when Curran was Beast Lord, but once he retired, I thought our tortures were over. Yeah, not so fast.<br><br>"Back in March, Roland's crews started harassing the teamsters," I said.<br><br>"In the city?" Roman raised his eyebrows.<br><br>"No." I had claimed the city of Atlanta to save it from my father, assuming responsibility for it. My father and I existed in a state of uneasy peace, and so far he hadn't openly breached it. "They would do it five, six miles outside of the land I claimed. The teamsters would be driving their wagons or trucks, and suddenly there would be twenty armed people blocking the road and asking them where they were going and why. It made the union nervous, so a teamster rep came to the Conclave and asked what anyone would be doing about that."<br><br>"Why not go to the Order?" Roman said. "That's what they do."<br><br>"The Order and the union couldn't come to an agreement," Curran said.<br><br>The Order of Knights of Merciful Aid offered that aid under some conditions, not the least of which was that once they took a job, they finished it on their terms, and their clients didn't always like the outcome.<br><br>"So the teamster rep asked the People point-blank to stop harassing their convoys," Curran said, "and Ghastek told him that Kate was the only person capable of making it happen."<br><br>"Did you?"<br><br>"I did," I said. "And now I have to go to the Conclave meetings."<br><br>"I'm there as a supportive spouse-to-be." Curran grinned, flashing his teeth.<br><br>"So why did your father mess with the convoys?" Roman asked.<br><br>"No reason. He does it to aggravate me. He's an immortal wizard with a megalomaniac complex. He doesn't understand words like 'no' and 'boundaries.' It bugs him that I have this land. He can't let it go, so he sits on my border and pokes it. He tried to build a tower on the edge of Atlanta. I made him move it, so now he's building himself 'a small residence' about five miles out."<br><br>"How small?" Roman asked.<br><br>"About thirty thousand square feet," Curran said.<br><br>Roman whistled, then knocked on the wooden table and spat over his shoulder three times.<br><br>Curran looked at me.<br><br>"Whistling in the house is bad luck," I explained.<br><br>"You'll whistle all your money away," Roman said. "Thirty thousand square feet, huh?"<br><br>"Give or take. He keeps screwing with her," Curran said. "His construction crews obstruct the Pack hunting grounds outside Atlanta. His soldiers nag the small settlements outside the claimed area, trying to get people to sell their land to him."<br><br>My father was slowly driving me insane. He'd cross into my territory when the magic was up, so I would feel his presence, then leave before I could get there to bust him. The first few times he had done it, I rode out, dreading a war, but there was never anyone to fight. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night because I'd feel him enter my land, and then I'd lie there gritting my teeth and fighting with myself to keep from grabbing my sword and running out of the house to hunt him down.<br><br>"Don't forget the monsters," I said. "They keep spawning outside the boundary and then raid Atlanta."<br><br>"Most of the time we can't tie it back to him," Curran said. "When we can, she calls him on it. He apologizes and makes generous reparations."</p><h2>The Art of Cuphead</h2><p><b>Get transported back to the golden age of 1930s animation with an art book celebrating the acclaimed run &amp; gun game, <i>Cuphead!</i></b><br><br>Each page of this curated collection of artwork is designed to capture the vintage look and feel of the 1930's.

Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In 1845 Henry David Thoreau left his pencil-manufacturing business and began building a cabin on the shore of Walden Pond near Concord, Massachusetts. This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind. Elegant, witty, and quietly searching, Walden remains the most persuasive American argument for simplicity of life clarity of conscience.<br><br>For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by major American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books.

On Interpretation. Prior Analytics (Loeb Classical Library No. 325)</h2><p><p>Aristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; <i>Great Ethics</i> (<i>Magna Moralia</i>); <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>; <i>Politics</i>; <i>Oeconomica</i> (on the good of the family); <i>Virtues and Vices</i>.<br>II. Logical: <i>Categories</i>; <i>On Interpretation</i>; <i>Analytics</i> (<i>Prior</i> and <i>Posterior</i>); <i>On Sophistical Refutations</i>; <i>Topica</i>.<br>III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc.<br>IV. <i>Metaphysics</i>: on being as being.<br>V. On Art: <i>Art of Rhetoric</i> and <i>Poetics</i>.<br>VI. Other works including the <i>Athenian Constitution</i>; more works also of doubtful authorship.<br>VII.

Murray, the first to turn a scholarly eye on the mysteries of witchcraft, enables us to see its existence in the Middle Ages not as an isolated and terrifying phenomenon, but as the survival of a religion nearly as old as humankind itself, whose devotees held passionately to a view of life threatened by an alien creed. The findings she sets forth, once thought of as provocative and implausible, are now regarded as irrefutable by folklorists and scholars in related fields. Exploring the rites and ceremonies associated with witchcraft, Murray establishes the concept of the "dying god"--the priest-king who was ritually killed to ensure the country and its people a continuity of fertility and strength. In this light, she considers such figures as Thomas a Becket, Joan of Arc, and Gilles de Rais as spiritual leaders whose deaths were ritually imposed.<br> Truly a classic work of anthropology, and written in a clear, accessible style that anyone can enjoy, <em>The God of the Witches</em> forces us to reevaluate our thoughts about an ancient and vital religion.<br></p><p><br>The late <strong>Margaret Murray</strong> is the author of <em>The Witch Cult in Western Europe</em>, also available from Oxford.<br>"An important and fascinating book."--New Statesman and Nation<br><br>"A book of absorbing interest."--Psychic News</p><h2>Morgan &amp; Mikhail's Clinical Anesthesiology</h2><p><p><b>The most user-friendly, clinically relevant overview of the practice of anesthesiology</b></p><p><strong>A Doody's Core Title for 2017!</strong></p><p>Current, concise, and engagingly written, <i>Morgan &amp; Mikhail&#x2019;s Clinical Anesthesiology, Fifth Edition</i> is a true essential for all anesthesia students and practitioners.

Advising mutual respect and recognition of accomplishments, Encouraging the Heart shows us how true leaders encourage and motivate those they work with by helping them find their voice and making them feel like heroes. Recognized experts in the field of leadership, authors James Kouzes and Barry Posner show us that, through love, leaders can encourage, and indeed allow those around them to be their very best. Both practical and inspirational, Encouraging the Heart gives readers a thoughtful approach to motivating individuals within an organizational structure.<br> Read Chapter 3 or Chapter 12, or see The Encouragement Index.</p><p>Leadership authorities James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner say employees perform best when their contributions are genuinely appreciated. Unfortunately, the two contend, most executives have not mastered the decidedly soft-management skill of "encouragement" that fosters such behavior. In <i>Encouraging the Heart</i>, they examine how this type of compassionate supervision is becoming a critical part of successful management today, and through example and suggestion they describe how readers can establish the process in their own businesses. <blockquote>This is not a book about glad-handing and backslapping, gold stars, and payoffs. It's about the importance of linking rewards and appreciation to standards of excellence. It's about why encouragement is absolutely essential to sustaining people's commitment to organizations and outcomes. It's about the hard work it takes to get extraordinary things done in organizations, and it's about ways to enhance your own ability in--and comfort with--recognizing and celebrating the achievements of others.</blockquote> The book's opening section introduces their concept of the caring leader; the second outlines their "seven essential principles" for encouraging workers; the third explains how the process can be personalized and describes 150 additional suggestions for implementing it. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>"Beyond the terrific stories and examples, <i>Encouraging the Heart</i> is a wonderful tool for creating a workforce that cares. In today's economy of job-hopping and nanosecond loyalty, can anything be more valuable?" <br> -- Patrick Lencioni, author, <i>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</i>, and president, The Table Group <p> "Kouzes and Posner have done it again. <i>Encouraging the Heart </i>is an insightful, easy-to-read book that shows modern leaders how to foster pride, courage, hope, ownership, and achievement. It's a wonderful mix of research findings and practical observations drawn from the authors' extensive experience with leaders." <br> &#x2014; William C.

Thinking with Nietzsche, in Jaspers words, means holding one s own against him, and we are indeed refreshed and challenged by the vortex of his thoughts, by concepts which test and probe. In The Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist, and Ecce Homo Nietzsche writes at breakneck speed of his provenance, his adversaries and his hopes for mankind; the books are largely epigrammatic and aphoristic, allowing this poet-philosopher to bewilder and fascinate us with their strangeness and their daring. He who fights with monsters, Nietzsche once told us, should look to it that he himself does not become one, and when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you. Reader, beware.</p><p>Nietzsche has been proclaimed the seminal figure of modern philosophy as well as one of the most creative and critically influential geniuses in the history of secular thought.Text: English (translation) <br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Monsters Among Us: An Exploration of Otherworldly Bigfoots, Wolfmen, Portals, Phantoms, and Odd Phenomena</h2><p><b>Have you ever seen something you couldn&#x2019;t explain? </b><br><br> This meticulously researched and thrilling exploration of the otherworldly will challenge your idea of reality.

Portals, wormholes, and space-time tunnels are most often depicted in today's religious and pop culture art as hovering in the clouds, but in fact are just as likely to be found lying beneath our feet. Caves, underground worlds, the Christian concept of hell, underground military installations, and even alien bases-all of these imply mysterious subterranean passageways of some kind, whether they are known physical constructs like elevators or sewers, or the more nebulous method of transport to a less-than-happy afterlife.<br><br>As above, so below is an ancient mantra that can be interpreted many ways. Many cultures have believed that, like the images in a reflecting pool, if there are portals in the sky that open for beings from heaven or the stars, then there must also be entrances in the ground from which darker beings climb or slither. And according to many mythic and legendary traditions, holes in the earth and hollowed-out mountains or caves have traditionally been considered entrances to hell, or, as Buffy of Joss Whedon's classic sci-fi TV series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, called them, hellmouths.<br><br>Hellmouths and Other Gates to the Underworld<br><br>When it comes to tunnels and other openings to the underworld, I've noticed something of a turnaround in their traffic patterns over the centuries. Modern myth and legends seem to be all about monsters, demons, and the like taking advantage of hellmouths to escape from disagreeable underworlds. Many episodes of Buffy, for instance, deal with a giant hellmouth deep beneath the local high school that's crammed chockablock with demons plotting to spill upward and wreak havoc on humanity. Underworld myths of earlier civilizations, however, focused more on heroic figures struggling to get into these abodes of monsters and dead people, and then, mission accomplished, returning to our world while the horrible entities stayed put where they belonged.<br><br>I think I like the old ways better.<br><br>The Gates of Mashu<br><br>A good example of the latter can be found in some of humanity's earliest written mythic accounts, in the journey of the ancient Sumerian hero king Gilgamesh. Many scholars believe the character is based on an actual ruler of the southern Mesopotamian kingdom of Uruk, once located in present-day Iraq. He would have lived between 2700 and 2500 BCE. In this epic and iconic tale, Gilgamesh seeks to enter the underworld in hope of finding something still sought by humanity today: everlasting life. But before he enters, this king must become a bit monstrous himself, by growing his hair long and dressing in animal skins.<br><br>Once he makes it to the twin-peaked mountain called Mashu, which marks the entrance to heaven and the underworld alike, he encounters savage guardians-an army of scorpion people, no less-at the mountain's gateway. Gilgamesh, always quite the socially adept schmoozer, manages to avoid a fight and talk his way past them and on into the mountain's interior. He must then hike down a thirty-six-mile tunnel in total darkness in order to complete his quest and learn how to become immortal.<br><br>I had to stop at this point to wonder at the fact that at least five thousand years or so ago, people had already formed the notion of other worlds beyond our own that were inhabited not only by our dead but by gods and monsters, all reachable by traversing long passageways extending deep underground. Today, many world religions also believe that humans may end up stuck permanently in a (usually) ghastly world below when they die. But Gilgamesh is different. In true heroic fashion, he discovers the magical flower of eternal youth and returns with it from the underworld-only to lose it to a serpent who gives the precious bloom to its reptilian kin and thereby cheats humanity of its chance at earthly immortality.<br><br>We all hate it when that happens. And the motif of the clever, deceptive serpent recurs often in the religious literature of the world. Readers familiar with the Bible, for instance, are doubtlessly right now picturing forbidden fruit, one persuasive reptile, and a couple who suddenly find themselves naked, afraid, and unemployed as well. But that's another book. The thing that's pertinent in the tale of Gilgamesh, the thing that our modern stories share with these older traditions, is that idea of humans and monsters coming and going from mysterious underground worlds.<br><br>Contemporary Hellmouths<br><br>I've often stated that I don't believe in the idea of actual, traditional werewolves-humans changing their flesh-and-blood bodies for those of flesh-and-blood canines in an unholy and unsociable union. Sometimes, however, I do receive a compelling report that makes me wonder if something like that is possible in certain situations. And I've always been willing to allow for some sort of spirit-generated facsimile or illusion of a wolfoid that at least looks like a werewolf.<br><br>If there were such a thing, it seems fitting that they should be said to lurk in the nether regions-in caves, mines, or even sewer systems. I have heard a rumor, for instance, that people have claimed to see werewolves in the sewers of Minot, North Dakota. I've never been able to verify it and haven't even found a single witness, but I've since received some other reports that make it a bit more likely than I thought.<br><br>The Phantom Wolf of Wolfsegg<br><br>Few things would sound more classically spooky than strange moans and howls emanating from a deep, dark cave in the heart of Germany's Bavarian Forest. Add a famous floating ghost known as the "woman in white," and then pile on the sighting of a phantom wolf reported by a soldier with Canadian forces stationed near there in 1987-all the ingredients for a vaunted passage to an underground world are present and accounted for.<br><br>The intriguingly named village of Wolfsegg in southern Germany is most famous for its eight-hundred-year-old castle, a must-see for many tourists. The soldier's wife, "S," wrote me to relate that his troop was stationed that year at a US military garrison facility called the Hohenfels Training Area, not far from Wolfsegg. He and his comrades were camping overnight in a farm field nearby the training facility, and on one particular evening he had chosen to bunk inside his M458 military track vehicle. He was awakened during the night by a strange scratching sound at the vehicle's window.<br><br>His wife wrote, "Suddenly a large canine head appeared in the window. It looked dog- or wolflike but had glowing red eyes (the eyes frightened my husband the most). It made bold eye contact for a couple of seconds, then disappeared from view. It would have had to have been six to seven feet tall [standing] on its hind legs to reach the window of the track vehicle from the ground.<br><br>"The next morning my husband tried to tell himself that he must have dreamed the whole thing, but he found tracks and paw prints all over the muddy ground outside his vehicle. He told his fellow soldiers about the spooky creature, but nobody knew what to make of it."<br><br>The thought of a huge, possibly phantom wolf roaming a military training ground and window-peeping at slumbering soldiers does sound a bit fantastic. I call it a "possibly phantom wolf" partly because of its red eyes. Canid eye shine is normally light yellow to greenish or golden yellow, although sometimes physical eye conditions or illness can change any animal's eyeshine hue. But as wolves were once very numerous throughout Europe, so were legends of large, black, red-eyed phantom wolves or dogs, believed by most clergy of the Middle Ages to be demonic. The noted German scholar Dr. Johann Keiler von Kaiserberg, for instance, preached a sermon on that subject in Strassburg in 1508. A local cleric published the good doctor's words, including this interesting sentence: "He certainly says that the Demon often appears in the shape of a wolf, and in his sermon on wild men of the woods he speaks of lycanthropes in Spain."<br><br>Synchronistically, S added that Wolfsegg's coat of arms features a wolf, actually the head of a black, shaggy wolf with a protruding red tongue.<br><br>The Wolfsegg Hole<br><br>But there's more than just history to link the Wolfsegg area to possible phantom creatures. As mentioned earlier, there's a well-known legend of a "woman in white" said to appear around the castle grounds. The apparition is thought to be the ghost of a woman killed in 1485 for marital transgressions.<br><br>Wolfsegg also is famed for a deep cave located about a hundred yards into the forest just outside the village. Residents nicknamed the cave "The Hole" due to its steep drop into a black, seeming abyss. It is at least thirty-five meters deep, and despite a few expeditions meant to discover its outlet, local tourism publications say it has never been fully explored.<br><br>A site called Travel Creepster claims, "There is a strange noise coming from the darkness of the Hole, sometimes just breathing, and sometimes grunts or growling, but the last thing witnesses would describe it as is human. The locals will tell you that the sounds are not natural of any creature they have ever heard, and they tell the story of travelers that got too close and were never seen again."<br><br>According to the site, one expedition led by scientists in 1920 entered the cave on the premise that the opening shaft was too steep to be used as a regular entrance by whatever animals were heard breathing in there and that therefore another, more horizontal level must exist. They did find horizontal tunnels, but they were much deeper than expected, and they were filled with animal bones that they judged had been left in the cave over a very long period of time by unknown carnivores. There are numerous other caves and old mines in the area as well, since this was once a very active iron mine region. And while I don't want to give the impression that tunnels to possible netherworlds are absolute requirements for sightings of werewolves-in-progress, people have sent me some stunning examples of cases where underground access seems to have played a part.<br><br>Encounter case summary: Phantom Wolf of Wolfsegg<br><br>Reported creature(s): Large, wolflike creature that left paw prints and also mud prints on vehicle.<br><br>Location, date: Hohenfels Training Area near Wolfsegg, Germany, 1987.<br><br>Conditions: Nighttime, clear weather.<br><br>Associated phenomena: Ghost apparition, extremely deep sinkhole with horizontal tunnels filled with animal bones and the site of unidentified grunts and growling.<br><br>Unexplained actions/appearance of creature: Height of six to seven feet, glowing red eyes (unlike yellowish, reflective canid eyes), and stood upright to peer into military truck window.<br><br>Witness(es): A Canadian soldier on training duty.<br><br>Environmental factors: Combination of woods and farms to provide possible small livestock as prey, and close proximity to a legendary deep sinkhole with a tunnel system near a military base.<br><br>chapter two<br><br>Liminal Los Angeles<br><br>Zooming back to the United States, we can explore a better-documented tale-first person, with two witnesses and a pinpoint geographical location-sent to me several years ago by a woman who had a close encounter with an apparent shape-shifter as it tried to hoist itself out of a manhole. It happened in Torrance, California, when she was just seven and her brother was fourteen. He won't talk publicly about it to this day, she says, but she remembers it clearly. I've left it in mostly her own words, edited slightly for spelling, brevity, and punctuation, with only a few added interjections of my own.<br><br>The Torrance Werewolf<br><br>"Well, it was a sunny afternoon in 1985, and I was with my brother and my mother at a Laundromat in Torrance, California, that we occasionally went to. We had just came from a store where my mom bought my brother and I our first Nerf ball to share. We were very excited and anxious to play with it. Well, we were helping mom put the clothes in the washer and getting change, etc. Then my brother and I started begging our mom to let us play with the Nerf ball in the parking lot. She of course said no, because it was too dangerous, so my brother said that he would be right back. He went looking around for a spot to play, and came back quickly. He said to my mom that he found a safe spot right behind the Laundromat, and it was an apartment-type complex with a long driveway where we would be safe from cars. She finally accepted.<br><br>"We ran as fast as we could to the back of the Laundromat. I remember my brother saying to me that he wanted me to go to the middle of the driveway and that he would be toward the front, just in case cars would drive in. That way he could be seen better, because he was taller. We started to play catch back and forth, throwing the ball different ways with spins and twirls and such. I remember we got pretty loud because we were having such fun. We were running and jumping, and we kept hitting the sides of the wall to this property and the open carports that were underneath the complex.<br><br>"After about thirty minutes or so my brother threw it so high and far that I had to fetch the ball from the last carport. The ball flew in all the way back to the carport wall, just beneath the storage compartment that each carport had. So I ran to go get it. I got the Nerf ball in my hands and turned around. Right there was a large, metal rectangular door on the ground that looked like it opened to an underground area.<br><br>"Well, there was a man that lifted the door and popped a little out from underneath this heavy thick metal door, and it was propped sort of on his back neck and shoulders . . . to where I could only see his upper body. I was at that moment freaked out and afraid. I was told to never talk to strangers. I was told constantly to never trust anyone by my mother, brother, and grandma. I wasn't allowed to go anywhere alone. So I was very frightened and stood still, looking at this man.<br><br>"The door was heavy, so it seemed as if he couldn't get enough strength to get all the way out of it. My only way to get past him was from the sides, because this door was directly in the middle of the end of the carport, facing outward. He looked at me, and said in a [rough] voice, 'What's all this noise, why are you making so much noise? What are you doing? Why are you here?' I didn't say anything. I just stared.</p><h2>The Witch of Blackbird Pond: Illustrations by Barry Moser</h2><p>Kit Tyler, a young girl from Barbados, visits her Puritan relatives in Connecticut only to become the object of a seventeenth-century witch hunt, in a re-release of a 1959 Newbery Award Winner with new illustrations.</p><p>Forced to leave her sunny Caribbean home for the bleak Connecticut Colony, Kit Tyler is filled with trepidation. As they sail up the river to Kit's new home, the teasing and moodiness of a young sailor named Nat doesn't help. Still, her unsinkable spirit soon bobs back up. What this spirited teenager doesn't count on, however, is how her aunt and uncle's stern Puritan community will view her. In the colonies of 1687, a girl who swims, wears silk and satin gowns, and talks back to her elders is not only headstrong, she is in grave danger of being regarded as a witch. When Kit befriends an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond, it is more than the ascetics can take: soon Kit is defending her life.

They have inadvertently put programmers and engineers in charge, leading to products and processes that waste huge amounts of money, squander customer loyalty, and erode competitive advantage. They have let the inmates run the asylum. Alan Cooper offers a provocative, insightful and entertaining explanation of how talented people continuously design bad software-based products. More importantly, he uses his own work with companies big and small to show how to harness those talents to create products that will both thrill their users and grow the bottom line.</p><p>In this book about the darker side of technology's impact on our lives, Alan Cooper begins by explaining that unlike other devices throughout history, computers have a "meta function:" an unwanted, unforeseen option that users may accidentally invoke with what they thought was a normal keystroke. Cooper details many of these meta functions to explain his central thesis: programmers need to seriously reevaluate the many user-hostile concepts deeply embedded within the software development process.<p> Rather than provide users with a straightforward set of options, programmers often pile on the bells and whistles and ignore or deprioritize lingering bugs. For the average user, increased functionality is a great burden, adding to the recurrent chorus that plays, "computers are hard, mysterious, unwieldy things." (An average user, Cooper asserts, who <i>doesn't</i> think that way or who has memorized all the esoteric commands and now lords it over others, has simply been desensitized by too many years of badly designed software.)</p><p> Cooper's writing style is often overblown, with a pantheon of cutesy terminology (i.e., "dancing bearware") and insider back-patting. (When presenting software to Bill Gates, he reports that Gates replied: "How did you <i>do</i> that?" to which he writes, "I love stumping Bill!") More seriously, he is also unable to see beyond software development's importance--a sin he accuses programmers of throughout the book.</p><p> Even with that in mind, the central questions Cooper asks are too important to ignore: Are we making users happier? Are we improving the process by which they get work done? Are we making their work hours more effective? Cooper looks to programmers, business managers, and what he calls "interaction designers" to question current assumptions and mindsets. Plainly, he asserts that the goal of computer usage should be "not to make anyone feel stupid." Our distance from that goal reinforces the need to rethink entrenched priorities in software planning. <i>--Jennifer Buckendorff</i></p>Alan Cooper is a software author and visionary whose industry credits include creating the visual programming interface for Microsoft&#39;s Visual Basic.

Deutsch Foundation Rubys Artist Grant for her writing and research.<p><b>Prologue</b></p><p>Late 1942</p><p><b>Gertud K�hlem &#x2014; aka Mucki</b></p><p>Mucki stepped out of her apartment onto narrow Boisseree Street. On Fridays, she had a standing date with her friends in the <i>Volksgarten</i>. Wearing leather loafers that probably needed to be replaced and white socks hanging around her ankles, Mucki made her way toward the park.</p><p>The mile between her house and the meeting spot was surrounded by destruction. Some buildings had roofs that looked like they had been removed by giants, others were just walls, or piles of brick and stone. Sides of buildings had black scorch marks streaming up around the windows. Trees with massive trunks had been snapped in half like matchsticks. Mucki was lucky the apartment where she and her mom lived still stood.</p><p>As she moved through the city, she knew at any moment a siren could go off, signaling another attack, and she&#x2019;d have to duck into the nearest air-raid shelter.</p><p>In the end, though, her trip was uneventful and when she arrived, the Volksgarten was empty. Before the war, the park would have been filled with people on a late afternoon like this: a mom out walking with her kids, a couple sitting on the bank of the pond whispering to each other, little dogs prancing around on their leashes. None of that happened anymore. The park was all but deserted, and that was how Mucki and her friends liked it.</p><p>This time, the Mountain Climber, Banjo Willi, �tz, and Jus showed up. Sometimes there were more people, sometimes fewer. Usually they talked, hung out, and sang songs&#x2014;all stuff that would have been typical for <i>b�ndische</i> youth groups in the early 1930s in Germany. Lately, they&#x2019;d been planning some stuff they didn&#x2019;t want anyone to hear about.</p><p>&#x201c;Listen up, I know what we should do next,&#x201d; said the Mountain Climber. He was skinny, with sinewy arms and legs, and on hikes, he was always the first to the top of a rock, or you&#x2019;d find him up in a tree somewhere. He was newer to the group, but really committed, and really trustworthy.</p><p>&#x201c;And what have you been thinking about?&#x201d; Mucki asked.</p><p>The Mountain Climber looked around the park to make sure no one was lingering.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought that we could fill a backpack full of flyers, I&#x2019;d throw it on my back, and make my way to the Cologne Central Station,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>He was crazy. They all knew that the main train station in Cologne was crawling with activity. Every day, the military used the trains to ship German soldiers to battle, and to send Jews, leftists, homosexuals, and anyone else they didn&#x2019;t like to a <i>KZ&#x2014;</i>a concentration camp. Every day, supplies and food arrived, along with forced laborers from Poland or occupied territories in the East. The Mountain Climber wanted to take the flyers and make them flutter down like dead leaves in an autumn wind, to show people that there was a resistance.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a way for you to find yourself in a camp,&#x201d; Mucki said. She knew this was not the plan of a person merely intent on surviving the war. She knew well that the punishment for this kind of thing could be jail, possible torture, concentration camps; her father had experienced it.</p><p>�tz agreed with Mucki and added, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to see my neck in the noose yet. I have a lot to live for.&#x201d; �tz was tall and scrawny too, and generally slanted his body in a way that made it seem like he didn&#x2019;t really care. But right now, he cared, and he wasn&#x2019;t convinced by the Mountain Climber&#x2019;s plans.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think I want to play a game with my own life?&#x201d; the Mountain Climber asked. &#x201c;Look, we only take calculated risks, and we make the decision together. But at least hear my plan.</p><p>&#x201c;I know the train station. In the middle is the big glass dome, and all around it are ladders for the workers, for when, you know, the electricity isn&#x2019;t right or they have to fix some other problem. I thought that I could climb one of those ladders with the backpack and just let all of the flyers go. Two or three of you keep watch below and I come back down. You&#x2019;ll all be safe. And then we get out of there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You realize that&#x2019;s really risky, right?&#x201d; said Jus, who hadn&#x2019;t said a word yet. Jus and Mucki trusted each other; they&#x2019;d been friends a long time.</p><p>&#x201c;But what do we have to lose?&#x201d; Mucki started to change her mind. &#x201c;Yeah, we could get caught. But we could have also got caught when we graffitied buildings around town. We&#x2019;ve done a lot and people haven&#x2019;t noticed. We need something to motivate us and something that reaches more people. I say we go for it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do we have a choice? We&#x2019;re already in it pretty deep.&#x201d; �tz seemed to change his mind too. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There can&#x2019;t be a worse fate than Hitler,&#x201d; Banjo Willi said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll go well,&#x201d; Jus said. Sometimes, he knew exactly what to say. &#x201c;So far we haven&#x2019;t had any big problems; why would it be any different this time?&#x201d;</p><p>The long August evening had almost come to an end, and dusk started to settle in. They hurried up and made their plan before dark, when they had to be home. They gave themselves two weeks.</p><p>Mucki took on the duty of getting the flyers. She made her way to a small street in Pesch, on the northern border of the Cologne city limits.</p><p>Jus had introduced them to a man with a small print shop in his basement. He normally printed church newsletters for Catholic congregations in the area. He knew that what they were doing was dangerous. If he got busted with the flyers, he wouldn&#x2019;t get off easy. Creating the material was one of the riskier parts of the operation. He couldn&#x2019;t play dumb like someone just carrying the flyers. So he had one stipulation: no one could know his name. They called him Tom.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Mucki,&#x201d; Tom said as she entered the shop. He didn&#x2019;t know her real name either.</p><p>Tom printed his church bulletins in a large font so that the older readers in the congregation could easily make out the words. This was perfect for the flyers since no one would dare pick one up for fear of being carried away by the police. Even looking too long at one on the ground could be risky. People would need to be able to read the messages as they walked by.</p><p>&#x201c;The flyers are under the canvas bags,&#x201d; Tom said. &#x201c;Goodbye.&#x201d; He had said ten words to Mucki and that was all he would say. The less they knew about each other the better. The less Tom knew about the operation the better.</p><p>She grabbed the package and put it under the padding of a baby stroller she&#x2019;d borrowed from a neighbor. She arranged pillows and a blanket inside the blue stroller to make it look like a child was snuggled inside. She gripped the handles as she quickly pushed it down the street.</p><p>The big wheels bounced over cobblestones and destroyed sidewalks. Her heart must have been pounding as she pushed the stroller through the outskirts of Cologne. What if someone wants to peek at the sleeping angel? What if someone questions the fact that she was eighteen with a baby? How would she cover? What would she say?</p><p>In the end, people around her didn&#x2019;t pay her any attention. They had their own worries. Would another air raid come tonight? Would their rations last until the end of the week? Could they get a new coat for winter? Had their neighbor overheard that private conversation? People in Cologne were known to mind their own business, and since the beginning of the war, that was even more true.</p><p>Finally, Mucki made it to a specific pile of rubble in Cologne. To someone who didn&#x2019;t know the city, that&#x2019;s what it looked like: one of the thousands of piles of stones, mortar, wood, and bricks that used to be a home, office, school, or church in the city. This heap had been a Catholic church. The steeple had fallen; the bells had been taken off to be melted down for the war long ago. This was the perfect place to stash the flyers until they needed them.</p><p>Mucki looked around to make sure no one had followed her. Quickly, she placed the flyers in a hole and put stones on top. Her job was done. Tomorrow, the Mountain Climber would begin his. He&#x2019;d be risking his life. They&#x2019;d all be risking their lives.</p><p>The Central Train Station was a magnificent building, almost as grand as the nearby Cologne Cathedral. The main entrance was under a semicircular glass window, probably forty feet in diameter. The glass dome arched just behind that window. This was where the Mountain Climber would ascend. At the busiest time of the evening, he&#x2019;d drop the flyers.</p><p>At 5:00 p.m., they were all there: the Mountain Climber; Mucki; Jus; �tz; Banjo Willi; and the Guardian, who hadn&#x2019;t been at the park. They gathered near a ladder inside, and the flow of rush-hour traffic moved around them. They had been visiting the train station daily around this time to figure out the layout, the best ladder for the Mountain Climber to use, and whether it really was safe.</p><p>No one seemed to be paying them any attention. People just moved about as normal.</p><p>One of the group winked. That was the sign. Time to start.</p><p>The Guardian and �tz went to two corner positions, Jus made his way to a platform across the tracks from where they had met, and Mucki and Banjo Willi stayed by the ladder, disguised as a couple in love. Willi slipped his hands around Mucki&#x2019;s waist and pressed his nose closer to her neck. Mucki&#x2019;s arms were around Willi&#x2019;s back. Their embrace was code: arms around each other&#x2019;s waists meant &#x201c;hold.&#x201d; They looked over each other&#x2019;s shoulders and could whisper without looking suspicious.</p><p>They looked for men in uniforms, taking in a 360-degree view of the station. Mucki looked over Willi&#x2019;s shoulder and whispered in his ear. Was everyone in place? He looked over her shoulder and whispered back. Were any men in uniforms nearby? They whispered again. This was as clear as it was ever going to be.</p><p>The Mountain Climber was keeping an eye on them near the ladder, waiting for the sign to begin. They whispered one last time. Slowly, Mucki raised her arms from Willi&#x2019;s waist up to his shoulders, and he did the same.</p><p>This was the sign. Like a cat, the Mountain Climber bounded to the top of the ladder, his long, chestnut-brown hair bouncing as he climbed.</p><p>Mucki and Willi scanned the station. No one seemed to have noticed. No expressions changed. No one looked up. No one was screaming about the boy on the ladder. No police. No Gestapo. This was good. With each passing moment, the risk increased.</p><p>All at once, paper sailed down from the ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>The words on Edelweiss Pirate flyers tended to be simple, the messages clear. They were printed with phrases like:</p><p>put an end to the brown-shirted horde!</p><p>soldiers, lay down your weapons!</p><p>we perish in this misery. this world is no longer our world. we have to fight for another world or we will perish, we will perish in this misery.</p><p>Before the first flyer hit the floor of the train station, the lovers had let go of each other, the Mountain Climber was down on the ground, and the others were safe too. The whole action had probably taken under fifteen minutes. They didn&#x2019;t stick around. They all moved quickly in different directions away from the train station.</p><p>The next day, the newspaper had the story: the action at the train station had been committed by a group of criminals.</p></p><h2>A Song to Sing, A Life to Live: Reflections on Music as Spiritual Practice (The Practices of Faith Series)</h2><p>In this rich exploration of music, authors Don and Emily Saliers interweave their own stories as well as those of others to reflect on the <i>what</i>, the <i>how</i>, and the <i>why</i> of music as a key aspect of spirituality in our lives.

While little of the pueblo itself remains, five centuries of history lie beneath the low rises of sandstone masonry, and theories about the events of that night are as persistent as the desert winds. The easternmost town on Antelope Mesa, Awat&#x2019;ovi was renowned for its martial strength, and had been the gateway to the entire Hopi landscape for centuries. Why did kinsmen target it for destruction?</p><p>Drawing on oral traditions, archival accounts, and extensive archaeological research, James Brooks unravels the story and its significance. <em>Mesa of Sorrows</em> follows the pattern of an archaeological expedition, uncovering layer after layer of evidence and theories. Brooks questions their reliability and shows how interpretations were shaped by academic, religious and tribal politics. Piecing together three centuries of investigation, he offers insight into why some were spared&#x2015;women, mostly, and taken captive&#x2015;and others sacrificed. He weighs theories that the attack was in retribution for Awat&#x2019;ovi having welcomed Franciscan missionaries or for the residents&#x2019; practice of sorcery, and argues that a perfect storm of internal and external crises revitalized an ancient cycle of ritual bloodshed and purification.</p><p>A haunting account of a shocking massacre, <em>Mesa of Sorrows</em> is a probing exploration of how societies confront painful histories, and why communal violence still plagues us today.</p> 38 illustrations</p><p>James F.

From the moment we are born, we are engaged in the learning and use of one or more complex languages. This imperative to employ language is deeply embedded in our genetic heritage. If two infants are placed together in isolation, they will begin to create their own language. So fundamental is the need to maintain communication with others that one of the most severe punishments we can inflict is solitary confinement.<br><br>Language is most often conveyed via speech and hearing, but we can just as readily use gesture and sight. Native Americans, for example, created relatively complex gesture languages for intertribal communication as well as for ritual use. Australian aborigines developed sign languages for use when speech was ritually taboo, such as during mourning periods for women or initiation ceremonies for men. Some linguists theorize that humans communicated via gesture for thousands of years before they developed speech.</p><p>In this 1907 school photograph, students and their teacher pose for the camera. All but two of the boys (first row, right) are able to be still for the seconds the shutter is snapped. Their signing to each other is captured and produces a double image. (Gallaudet University Archives, #13747-18, Washington, DC; from the Alice Teegarden Album.)</p><br>&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>&nbsp;<p><br>However, most sign languages, especially the most complex among them, have been developed by Deaf communities. Just as geographical and cultural conditions that isolate populations have led to the creation of distinct spoken languages, so has the physical and social condition of not hearing led to the creation of Deaf communities and sign languages. Hundreds of sign languages are in use around the world today. While each is distinct, all use the shape, orientation, position, and movement of the hands, as well as subtle uses of facial expression and movement of the head and body. Combinations of these elements make possible a variety of linguistic expressions as unlimited as the combinations of sounds used in spoken languages</p>&nbsp;<p><br>Deaf people also cultivate, to varying degrees, the difficult arts of lipreading and speaking (tasks made more or less challenging by, among other factors, the degree of deafness and the age at which deafness occurred). Lipreading is difficult and imprecise in any language, and it is made even trickier by the many sounds and words in English that look identical on the lips. Sole reliance upon oral communication has been more common among some populations than others, such as those people who became deaf as adults. The more common alternative for people deaf from an early age has been to cultivate a means of communication better suited to the visual sense, in other words, some form of gestural language.</p><br>&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>&nbsp;<p><b>AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE</b><br><br>Whenever significant numbers of deaf people have congregated in one place, as in large cities or in residential schools, Deaf communities that rely on naturally evolving sign languages have come into existence. The little-known history of the American Deaf community parallels the experiences and struggles of other minority groups. Deaf Americans have organized politically to protect and promote their interests; formed local, state, and national organizations; established newspapers and magazines; founded schools; and gathered in churches where American Sign Language was the language of song and sermon alike. The great majority have found not just their friends but their spouses within the Deaf community.<br><br>American Sign Language (ASL) is the visual/gestural language that is the primary means of communication within the Deaf community in America and parts of Canada. ASL signs, like spoken language words, represent concepts. Many of the signs correspond fairly directly with English words, but many do not. Interpreting from ASL into English and vice versa is a difficult and inexact task, just as interpreting between any two languages always is.<br><br>American Sign Language traces its roots not to Britain, as American English does, but to early nineteenth-century French Sign Language because the first deaf teacher in the United States came from France. While ASL and French Sign Language have diverged considerably over the years, they are still mutually intelligible to a limited extent&#x2014;somewhat like modern Spanish and Italian. British Sign</p>&nbsp;<p><br><br>Language and ASL are, for the most part, mutually unintelligible. Similarly, the vocabulary and grammar of ASL are distinct from English. ASL has its own syntax and is governed by a unique set of grammatical rules, just as Japanese Sign Language is distinct from spoken Japanese, and Swedish Sign Language is distinct from spoken Swedish.<br><br>In spite of the upsurge in ASL research in recent decades and the growing popularity of ASL courses in high schools and colleges, misconceptions about this language are still common. For example, many people assume that there is</p><br>&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>&nbsp;one universal sign language. This assumption often coexists with the entirely incompatible and equally erroneous notion that ASL was invented by educators as a visual representation of English. The usual conflation of &#x201c;language&#x201d; with &#x201c;spoken language&#x201d; is behind such beliefs, and this makes it difficult to convince people that ASL is a natural language, like any other (whether spoken or signed) that has evolved within a linguistic community.<br><br>ASL is often confused with the manual communication systems invented in the 1970s for the purpose of teaching written English to deaf children. These systems attempt to represent English on the hands by adding prefixes, suffixes, and verb-tense endings to ASL signs and by arranging the signs in English word order. &#x201c;Manually Coded English&#x201d; systems have their roots in the early nineteenth-century system called &#x201c;methodical sign language,&#x201d; which was used in the schools in France and the United States. These systems are codes, not true languages.<br><br>Because deaf people live among hearing people, they typically are bilingual. Much as Spanish speakers living in the United States sprinkle their conversations with English words and expressions, deaf people introduce elements of English into ASL. They <i>fingerspell</i> (use particular handshapes to represent the letters of the English alphabet) many proper nouns, such as personal names, place names, brand names, and titles of books, plays, and movies. They also fingerspell to communicate exact English words. Fingerspelling lies along the boundary of the hearing and Deaf worlds and mediates between English and ASL.<br><br>Like spoken languages, ASL is handed down from generation to generation, but this transference occurs most often within the Deaf community rather than in hearing families, in which, typically, there is only one deaf member. Descriptions of signs from the nineteenth century indicate that the language of the Deaf community, which was called &#x201c;the natural language of signs,&#x201d; has not changed essentially since that time. Films made by the National Association of the Deaf between 1910 and 1921 show deaf people using a sign language that, while different in some particulars, such as the production of certain signs and style of delivery, is understandable to ASL users today. How has that intergenerational transmission occurred? This brings us to the question of culture.<p><b>DEAF CULTURE</b><br><br>Deaf people have formed distinct cultures and signed languages all over the world for at least the last three hundred years. Indeed, wherever sufficient numbers of deaf people have been present, they have formed social groups in which a visually oriented language and culture flourish. These cultures do not include all who lack hearing but rather those deaf people who use sign language, share certain attitudes about themselves and their relation to the hearing world, and identify themselves as a part of a Deaf community. In American Sign Language, this is often referred to as the <i>Deaf-World</i>.</p><p><i>What makes Deaf people a cultural group instead of simply a loose organization of people with a similar sensory loss is the fact that their adaptation includes language. An environment created solely by a sensory deprivation does not make a culture. . . . What does form a culture for Deaf people is the fact that the adaptation to a visual world has by human necessity included a visual language. In the United States this is American Sign Language. . . .</i><br><br><i>This cultural identity is intrinsically bound to the language. When the Northern and Southern soldiers in a Deaf Civil War legend signed what could be glossed as DEAF-SAME, it was not an affirmation of a mutual lack of hearing, but rather one of mutual identity. In fact, in this legend, which continues to be told, it is an identity that transcended North and South allegiances. (Susan D. Rutherford, &#x201c;The Culture of American Deaf People,&#x201d; Sign Language Studies 51 [Summer 1988]: 725&#x2013;26, 729)</i></p><p>The American Deaf community is characterized by a number of cultural attributes, among them the possession of a rich and diverse literature. Like many languages spoken all around the world today, ASL does not have a commonly used written form, but it does have a long-standing unwritten literature that includes various forms of oratory, folklore, and performance art. The rhetorical style of oratory is marked by the use of particular, sometimes archaic, signs, and is used for formal occasions. Folklore</p><br>&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>&nbsp;<p><br>includes a variety of traditional language arts, such as narratives on traditional themes, jokes and puns, games, and distinctive naming practices. Performance art includes poetry and plays composed in ASL. These genres follow conventions analogous to, but distinct from, those of spoken languages. ASL poetry, for example, is based upon visual rather than aural patterns. This literature has been recorded on film, videotape, and digital media dating back to 1902.<br><br>Deaf culture has also been expressed in an astonishing array of social, political, and economic organizations. The</p>&nbsp;<p><br>National Association of the Deaf, founded in 1880, currently has active member affiliates in every state. Local clubs have long served as regular meeting places and social centers. The National Fraternal Society of the Deaf was founded in 1901 to provide insurance to deaf people, and over the years it has expanded its operations to become involved in legislative, civic, and social activities. Since 1945, the American Athletic Association of the Deaf has organized sporting events on a national level, as well as American participation in what is now known as the Deafolympics. Dozens of newspapers and magazines written by and for deaf people, with titles such as the <i>Silent</i></p><br>&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>&nbsp;<p><br><i>Worker</i>, <i>Deaf Life</i>, and <i>Silent News</i>, have existed within the Deaf community over the past century and a half.<br><br>These more formal expressions of culture are only the tip of the iceberg. Cultural expression is manifested most importantly in the decisions and actions of everyday life. Deaf cultural norms dictate the rules for the sharing of information, how to politely begin and take turns during a conversation, and appropriate etiquette for social gatherings. When deaf people marry other deaf people (which they do over 90 percent of the time), that, too, is an expression of cultural values. The transmission of cultural knowledge between generations, which has gone on remarkably effectively in spite of tremendous obstacles, is both the necessary precondition for, as well as the mark of, an enduring culture.</p>&nbsp;<p><br><b>ORAL COMMUNICATION</b><br><br><i>Lipreading, like sculpting or painting, is an art.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2014;Bonnie Tucker, <i>The Feel of Silence</i><br><br>Deaf people have always communicated by oral means to one extent or another, either exclusively or in addition to sign language. People who lose their hearing in adulthood</p><br>&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>&nbsp;<p><br><br>are less likely to learn to sign or to identify with Deaf culture; however, signers and nonsigners share many experiences, face similar struggles, and work together on many issues. Their combined efforts have contributed to the development of new technologies such as the teletypewriter (TTY) and television closed captioning, and civil rights legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act.<br><br>&#x201c;You are at a store purchasing something.

There are more than 300 species of native California grasses and they are found in almost every climate&#x2015;from cool, wet forests to hot, dry deserts. Native grasses are also important to land restoration as they improve soil quality, increase water infiltration, and recycle nutrients. Their deep roots can tap soil water, which allows them to stay green year-round and to act as fire buffers around residences. Native grasses also provide vital habitat for many species of insects, birds, reptiles, and mammals. Despite their importance, grasslands remain one of the most underprotected of California's vegetation types, and native grasslands have undergone the greatest percentage loss of any habitat type in the state. Grasses are also among the most difficult plants to identify. Organized alphabetically, <i>Field Guide to Grasses of California</i> covers common native and naturalized grasses and, to help identify them, also features over 180 color illustrations.</p><p><b>James P.

Barry underwent several surgeries as a child, but it wasn&#39;t until she was in college that she realized she wasn&#39;t seeing in 3-D. The medical profession has believed that the visual center of the brain can&#39;t rewire itself after a critical cutoff point in a child&#39;s development, but in her 40s, with the help of optometric vision therapy, Barry showed that previously neglected neurons could be nudged back into action. The author tells a poignant story of her gradual discovery of the shapes in flowers in a vase, snowflakes falling, even the folds in coats hanging on a peg. After Barry&#39;s story was written up in the New Yorker by Oliver Sacks, she heard from many others who had successfully learned to correct their vision as adults, challenging accepted wisdom about the plasticity of the brain.

She speaks regularly to scientists, eye doctors, and educators on the topic of neuronal plasticity. She has been featured on NPR and in a New Yorker article by renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks entitled &#x201c;Stereo Sue.&#x201d; She and her husband have two grown children and live in South Hadley, Massachusetts.<b>From the foreword by Oliver Sacks</b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Fixing My Gaze</i> is a beautiful description and appreciation of two very distinct ways of seeing... But it is also an exploration of much more. Sue is at pains not only to present her story, in clear and lucid, often poetic, language, but also, as a scientist, to provide understanding and explanation. She is in a unique position to do this, drawing on both her personal experience and her background as a neurobiologist....<p>Though Sue originally thought her own case unique, she has since found a number of other people with strabismus and related problems who have unexpectedly achieved stereo vision through vision therapy. This is no easy accomplishment. It may require not only optical corrections (proper lenses or prisms, for example), but very intensive training and learning&#x2014;in effect, learning how to align the eyes and to fuse their images, and unlearning the unconscious habit of suppressing vision which has been occurring perhaps for decades. In this way, vision therapy is directed at the whole person: it requires high motivation and self-awareness, and enormous perseverance, practice and determination, as does psychotherapy, for instance, or learning to play the piano. But it is also highly rewarding, as Sue brings out. And this ability to acquire new perceptual abilities later in life has great implications for anyone interested in neuroscience or rehabilitation, and, of course, for the millions of people who, like Sue, have been strabismic since infancy.</p><p>Sue's case, and many others, suggest that if there are even small islands of function in the visual cortex, there may be a fair chance of reactivating and expanding them in later life, even after a lapse of decades, if vision can be made optically possible. Cases like these may offer new hope for those once considered incorrigibly stereo-blind. <i>Fixing My Gaze</i> will offer inspiration for anyone in this situation, but it is equally a very remarkable exploration of the brain's ability to change and adapt, and an ode to the fascination and wonder of the visual world, even those parts of it which many of us take for granted.&#x201d;<br></p><br><br><b>Temple Grandin, author of&nbsp;</b><i><b>Thinking in Pictures</b></i><i><b><br> &#x201c;Essential reading for people interested in the brain.&#x201d;<br> </b></i><p><i><b><b>Eric Kandel, Winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine; author of&nbsp;</b><i><b>In Search of Memory</b></i></b></i><br> <i><b><i><b>&#x201c;<i>Fixing My Gaze</i>&nbsp;is a magical book, at once poetic and scientific, that holds out great hope for all of us.

Brown This book is for designers who want to consider the form-generating potential of sun, wind, and light in the earliest stages of the design process. It is designed to fit with the rapid, conceptual, exploratory, and synthetic thinking that characterizes the beginning of the design process. The book stresses the energy implications of using sun, wind, and light. However, it is organized by the architectural elements designers manipulate&#x2014;streets, open spaces and buildings, rooms and courtyards, and walls, roofs, floors, and windows. These elements are discussed in terms of their organization&#x2014;layered, elongated, dispersed, compact, and zoned&#x2014;and their attributes&#x2014;shape, orientation, enclosure, edge, and size. In addition, the contents are matched to the scale that is being considered&#x2014;building groups, individual buildings, and building parts. Sun, Wind, and Light is divided into three parts: The Design Strategies section is intended to help the designer formulate the basic concept for a project. This section uses a one- or two-page format that contains a simple memorable statement of the strategy, a clear, concise explanation of the strategy, several provocative historical and contemporary architectural illustrations of the potential impact of the strategy on a building&#x2019;s form and organization, and a rule of thumb that allows the designer to size elements instantly, without calculation. This format makes the strategies stimulating, fast to use, and easy to integrate with other design concerns. The Analysis Techniques section helps the designer define the context of the problem by understanding the sun, wind, and light resources of a particular site and climate, and how those resources can be used in a particular building to reduce the energy used for heating, cooling, and lighting. The third section, Strategies For Supplementing Passive Systems, addresses the ways design strategies can be supplemented with conventional heating, cooling, and lighting systems. The book is extensively referenced so that more detailed information can be located easily. It contains a glossary of energy-related terms so that it can be used effectively by those who are not energy experts. For easy retrieval of information, the book is indexed by subject, building, and architect, and by charts, graphs, and tables.</p><p>A text for architectural design studio courses, geared to inspire design ideas and to help students understand the energy consequence of design decisions. Concentrates on the analysis of sun, wind, and light resources of a particular site and climate. Also offers design strategies organized by building groups, buildings and building parts, and provides strategies for supplementing passive systems. Includes over 200 beautifully rendered architectural illustrations.Architecture/Sustainability &amp; Green Design<br><br><b>Design net-zero energy buildings that heat and power with the sun, cool with the wind, light with the sky.</b>The updated sustainable design classic * Doubled content * Focused on designing for Architecture 2030 carbon-neutral performance targets * Tools to connect related strategies<br>Developed for rapid use during schematic design, this book clarifies relationships between form and energy and gives designers tools for designing sustainably.&nbsp;<b></b><b></b><b>Part I-VII: 400-page printed book (free download)</b>* Multiple aids for navigation<br>* A new knowledge structure for net-zero design<br>* 7 synergies and 9 strategy bundles<br>* 6 high-performance building assessment methods* Condensed versions of favorite strategies and tools<b></b><b></b><b>Part VIII-IX: 450 Page electronic book</b>* Searchable PDF documents* Over 100 preliminary design strategies* 29 design analysis techniques<b></b><b></b><b>Digital Extras (free download)</b>* The <i>SWL Tools </i>spreadsheet for net-zero design (62 pages)* <i>Climate Calendars </i>data spreadsheets for U.S. climates (28 cities)* 700 pages of <i>Climatic Context </i>reports for U.S. climate regions</p><h2>Hamlet (The Pelican Shakespeare)</h2><p><b>The acclaimed Pelican Shakespeare series edited by A.

This view overlooks the significance of America&#x2019;s Hispanic past. With the profile of the United States increasingly Hispanic, the importance of recovering the Hispanic dimension to our national story has never been greater. <p>This absorbing narrative begins with the explorers and conquistadores who planted Spain&#x2019;s first colonies in Puerto Rico, Florida, and the Southwest. Missionaries and rancheros carry Spain&#x2019;s expansive impulse into the late eighteenth century, settling California, mapping the American interior to the Rockies, and charting the Pacific coast. During the nineteenth century Anglo-America expands west under the banner of &#x201c;Manifest Destiny&#x201d; and consolidates control through war with Mexico. In the Hispanic resurgence that follows, it is the peoples of Latin America who overspread the continent, from the Hispanic heartland in the West to major cities such as Chicago, Miami, New York, and Boston. The United States clearly has a Hispanic present and future.</p><p>And here is its Hispanic past, presented with characteristic insight and wit by one of our greatest historians.</p> 3 illustrations</p><p>Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto, the William P.

Indeed, Whitaker argues, modern treatments for the severely mentally ill are just old medicine in new bottles and we as a society are deluded about their efficacy. Tracing over three centuries of &#34;cures&#34; for madness, Whitaker shows how medical therapies-from &#34;spinning&#34; or &#34;chilling&#34; patients in colonial times to more modern methods of electroshock, lobotomy, and drugs-have been used to silence patients and dull their minds, deepening their suffering and impairing their hope of recovery. Based on exhaustive research culled from old patient medical records, historical accounts, and government documents, this haunting book raises important questions about our obligations to the mad, what it means to be &#34;insane,&#34; and what we value most about the human mind.</p><p>Hot on the heels of an optimistic film about Nobelist John Nash's schizophrenic journey comes medical journalist Robert Whitaker's disturbing expos� of the cruel and corrupt business of treating mental illness in America. <i>Mad in America</i> begins by surveying three centuries of mental health treatments to discover why positive outcomes for schizophrenics in the U.S. for the last 25 years have decreased--making them lower than those in developing countries. Whitaker asks, "Why should living in a country with such rich resources and advanced medical treatments for disorders of every kind, be so toxic to those who are severely mentally ill?"<p> One of Whitaker's answers draws upon the historic and current assumptions of a physical cause for schizophrenia. This resulted in cruel and unusual physical treatments--from ice-water immersion and bloodletting to the more contemporary electroshock, lobotomy, and drug therapies with dangerous side effects. This physical cause model leads to Whitaker's more provocative explanation: that mental illness has become a profit center. He offers disturbing details about how good business for drug companies makes for bad medicine in treating schizophrenia. From drug companies skewing their studies and patient/subjects kept in the dark about experiments to the cozy relationship between the American Psychiatric Association and drug companies, Whitaker underlines the mistreatment of the mentally ill. This courageous and compelling book succeeds as both a history of our attitudes toward mental illness and a manifesto for changing them. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p>Robert Whitaker&#39;s articles on the mentally ill and the drug industry have won several awards, including the George Polk Award for medical writing and the National Association of Science Writers&#39; Award for best magazine article.

The newcomer to classic poetry and prose, in particular, may experience in their spoken form an awakening to the beauty and power of these literary masters. It&#39;s hard to imagine a better introduction to William Blake&#39;s poetry than stage actors Brian Murray&#39;s and Suzanne Toren&#39;s audio rendition of SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE. Their alternating readings of Songs of Innocence vibrate with the reverence of Blake&#39;s vision of childhood as paradise lost; in Songs of Experience one fully senses Blake&#39;s later disillusion. The two books provide counterpoint to each other, an effect enhanced by the use of male and female readers.

The chapters may be read independently of one another. But when read in order, they tell a more or less continuous story. We begin with some reflections about the legacy of Socrates and then go on to the existence of God, which is perhaps the most basic philosophical question of all because our answer to it influences how we will answer all the others. This leads naturally to a discussion of death and the soul, and then to more modern ideas about the nature of persons. The later chapters are about whether it is possible for us to have objective knowledge in either science or ethics." James Rachels, from the Preface <p> <i>Problems from Philosophy</i> and <i>The Truth About the World: Basic Readings in Philosophy</i> are at once James Rachels' newest contributions to philosophy and his last. In these two books, Rachels found a culminating expression for his love of philosophy.</p></p><p>James Rachels, the distinguished American moral philosopher, was born in Columbus, Georgia, graduating from Mercer University in Macon in 1962. He received his Ph.D. in 1967 from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He taught at the University of Richmond, New York University, the University of Miami, Duke University, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he spent the last twenty-six years of his career. 1971 saw the publication of Rachels&#x2019; groundbreaking textbook Moral Problems, which ignited the movement in America away from teaching ethical theory towards teaching concrete practical issues. Moral Problems sold 100,000 copies over three editions. In 1975, Rachels wrote &#x201c;Active and Passive Euthanasia,&#x201d; arguing that the distinction so important in the law between killing and letting die has no rational basis. Originally appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine, this essay has been reprinted roughly 300 times and is a staple of undergraduate education. The End of Life (1986) was about the morality of killing and the value of life. Created from Animals (1990) argued that a Darwinian world-view has widespread philosophical implications, including drastic implications for our treatment of nonhuman animals. Can Ethics Provide Answers? (1997) was Rachels&#x2019; first collection of papers (others are expected posthumously). Rachels&#x2019; McGraw-Hill textbook, The Elements of Moral Philosophy, is now in its fourth edition and is easily the best-selling book of its kind. Over his career, Rachels wrote 5 books and 85 essays, edited 7 books and gave about 275 professional lectures. His work has been translated into Dutch, Italian, Japanese, and Serbo-Croatian. James Rachels is widely admired as a stylist, as his prose is remarkably free of jargon and clutter. A major theme in his work is that reason can resolve difficult moral issues. He has given reasons for moral vegetarianism and animal rights, for affirmative action (including quotas), for the humanitarian use of euthanasia, and for the idea that parents owe as much moral consideration to other people&#x2019;s children as they do to their own. James Rachels died of cancer on September 5th, 2003, in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><h2>Johannes Vermeer</h2><p>In this strikingly beautiful book, leading Vermeer scholars examine the life and works of this seventeenth-century Dutch master, analyzing his evolution from a painter of religious and mythological images to an artist who explored the psychological nuances of human endeavor.</p><p>Despite the federal budget crisis and thanks to private monies, the Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery is underway. To coincide with the exhibition, curator Wheelock has put together a thoroughly researched catalog of the exhibition's 23 works. Through the bits of evidence gleaned from Vermeer's life and 17th-century historical fact, Wheelock has pieced together Vermeer's artistic and geographical influences. The essay on the artist's use of perspective is the most remarkable because it enables the reader to understand the technician behind the artist; X-radiographs, included throughout the book, detail how Vermeer used a pin and a string to exercise his near-perfect perspective in his paintings. The excellent, full-size color plates are accompanied by brief descriptions of provenance, exhibitions, and technique. Although some claims made about the artist lack written documentation, this carefully researched work is recommended for fine arts collections. Given the popularity of the exhibition, large public libraries will also want to purchase.<br><i>Julie C.

Tolkien into the legends of Arthur, king of Britain, may well be regarded as his finest and most skillful achievement in the use of Old English alliterative meter, in which he brought to his transforming perceptions of the old narratives a pervasive sense of the grave and fateful nature of all that is told: of Arthur&#x2019;s expedition overseas into distant heathen lands, of Guinevere&#x2019;s flight from Camelot, of the great sea battle on Arthur&#x2019;s return to Britain, in the portrait of the traitor Mordred, in the tormented doubts of Lancelot in his French castle.<p></p>Unhappily, <i>The Fall of Arthur</i> was one of several long narrative poems that Tolkien abandoned. He evidently began it in the 1930s, and it was sufficiently advanced for him to send it to a very perceptive friend who read it with great enthusiasm at the end of 1934 and urgently pressed him, "You simply must finish it!" But in vain: he abandoned it at some unknown date, though there is evidence that it may have been in 1937, the year of publication of <i>The Hobbit</i> and the first stirrings of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Years later, in a letter of 1955, he said that he "hoped to finish a long poem on <i>The Fall of Arthur</i>," but that day never came.<p></p>Associated with the text of the poem, however, are many manuscript pages: a great quantity of drafting and experimentation in verse, in which the strange evolution of the poem&#x2019;s structure is revealed, together with narrative synopses and significant tantalizing notes. In these notes can be discerned clear if mysterious associations of the Arthurian conclusion with <i>The Silmarillion</i>, and the bitter ending of the love of Lancelot and Guinevere, which was never written.</p><p>HMH&nbsp;hardcover, ISBN&nbsp;978-0-544-11589-7J.R.R. TOLKIEN&nbsp;(1892&#x2013;1973) is the creator of Middle-earth and author of such classic and extraordinary works of fiction as <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and <i>The Silmarillion</i>.

This diverse and powerful body of literature has established a specific practice of colonial writing in cultures as diverse as India, Australia, the West Indies, Africa and Canada. This comprehensive study opens debates about the interrelationships of these literatures, investigates the powerful forces acting on language in the post-colonial text and shows how these texts constitute a radical critique of the assumptions underlying Eurocentric notions of literature and language.</p><p>Bill Ascroft is affiliated with the University of New South Wales, Gareth Griffiths with the University of Western Australia, and Helen Tiffin is with the University of Queensland.</p><h2>Christian Paths to Health and Wellness</h2><p><p><i>Christian Paths to Health and Wellness, Second Edition,</i> offers a unique, faith-based perspective on the pursuit of wellness for body, mind, and spirit. Written for undergraduate students attending Christian universities, this updated edition also serves as a reference for anyone seeking God-pleasing guidance to make positive life changes. </p><p><i>Christian Paths to Health and Wellness</i> will help you </p><p> � develop cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, and flexibility; </p><p> � apply principles of good nutrition; </p><p> � manage stress and better understand other issues affecting emotional wellness; </p><p> � learn the importance of regular, sound sleep; and </p><p> � understand how to develop and maintain healthy relationships. </p><p> In this new edition, you&#x2019;ll find the latest research on nutrition and fitness woven into an engaging narrative complemented by true stories of personal empowerment. This inspiring book will help you take charge of your health, learn about the importance of physical wellness to the whole person, and apply aspects of behavior modification in reaching your goals. </p><p> Like the first edition, <i>Christian Paths to Health and Wellness, Second Edition</i>, draws on the expertise and perspective of a team of Christian academics engaged in teaching health and wellness courses with a Christian foundation. Learning features in the text, including chapter outcomes and review questions, offer guideposts for retaining and referencing information. Application activities help you reflect on chapter content as you consider, through exercises and written reflections, how to translate what you&#x2019;ve learned to your own life. &#x201c;Point/counterpoint&#x201d; discussions give you a forum for discussing a topic from alternative perspectives. In addition, a glossary defines new terms, which are highlighted in bold type throughout the text and included in lists of key terms in each chapter. For instructors, free access to online ancillaries, including an instructor guide, presentation package with image bank, and test package, offer comprehensive support for course delivery and assessment. </p><p> Psalm 119 reminds us that God&#x2019;s word &#x201c;is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.&#x201d; In this way, the second edition of <i>Christian Paths to Health and Wellness</i> considers how scripture speaks about caring for your whole being and encourages you&#x2014;through tools, information, and strategies&#x2014;to live a focused life fixed on godly physical goals. </p></p><p><p><b>Peter Walters, PhD, </b>is a professor in the department of applied health science at Wheaton College, a private, interdenominational Christian college in Illinois.

Christopher Van Wyk and Sedgewick have developed new C++ implementations that both express the methods in a concise and direct manner, and also provide programmers with the practical means to test them on real applications.</p> <p>Many new algorithms are presented, and the explanations of each algorithm are much more detailed than in previous editions. A new text design and detailed, innovative figures, with accompanying commentary, greatly enhance the presentation. The third edition retains the successful blend of theory and practice that has made Sedgewick's work an invaluable resource for more than 250,000 programmers!</p> <p>This particular book, Parts 1n4, represents the essential first half of Sedgewick's complete work. It provides extensive coverage of fundamental data structures and algorithms for sorting, searching, and related applications. Although the substance of the book applies to programming in any language, the implementations by Van Wyk and Sedgewick also exploit the natural match between C++ classes and ADT implementations.</p> <b>Highlights</b> <ul> <li>Expanded coverage of arrays, linked lists, strings, trees, and other basic data structures </li><li>Greater emphasis on abstract data types (ADTs), modular programming, object-oriented programming, and C++ classes than in previous editions </li><li>Over 100 algorithms for sorting, selection, priority queue ADT implementations, and symbol table ADT (searching) implementations </li><li>New implementations of binomial queues, multiway radix sorting, randomized BSTs, splay trees, skip lists, multiway tries, B trees, extendible hashing, and much more </li><li>Increased quantitative information about the algorithms, giving you a basis for comparing them </li><li>Over 1000 new exercises to help you learn the properties of algorithms </li> </ul> <p>Whether you are learning the algorithms for the first time or wish to have up-to-date reference material that incorporates new programming styles with classic and new algorithms, you will find a wealth of useful information in this book.</p></p><p><p> This book is intended to survey the most important computer algorithms in use today, and to teach fundamental techniques to the growing number of people in need of knowing them. It can be used as a textbook for a second, third, or fourth course in computer science, after students have acquired basic programming skills and familiarity with computer systems, but before they have taken specialized courses in advanced areas of computer science or computer applications. The book also may be useful for self-study or as a reference for people engaged in the development of computer systems or applications programs, since it contains implementations of useful algorithms and detailed information on these algorithms' performance characteristics. The broad perspective taken makes the book an appropriate introduction to the field. </p><p> I have completely rewritten the text for this new edition, and I have added more than a thousand new exercises, more than a hundred new figures, and dozens of new programs. I have also added detailed commentary on all the figures and programs. This new material provides both coverage of new topics and fuller explanations of many of the classic algorithms. A new emphasis on abstract data types throughout the book makes the programs more broadly useful and relevant in modern programming environments. People who have read old editions of the book will find a wealth of new information throughout; all readers will find a wealth of pedagogical material that provides effective access to essential concepts. </p><p> Due to the large amount of new material, we have split the new edition into two volumes (each about the size of the old edition) of which this is the first. This volume covers fundamental concepts, data structures, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms; the second volume covers advanced algorithms and applications, building on the basic abstractions and methods developed here. Nearly all the material on fundamentals and data structures in this edition is new. </p><p> This book is not just for programmers and computer-science students. Nearly everyone who uses a computer wants it to run faster or to solve larger problems. The algorithms in this book represent a body of knowledge developed over the last 50 years that has become indispensible in the efficient use of the computer, for a broad variety of applications. From N-body simulation problems in physics to genetic-sequencing problems in molecular biology, the basic methods described here have become essential in scientific research; and from database systems to Internet search engines, they have become essential parts of modern software systems. As the scope of computer applications becomes more widespread, so grows the impact of many of the basic methods covered here. The goal of this book is to serve as a resource for students and professionals interested in knowing and making intelligent use of these fundamental algorithms as basic tools for whatever computer application they might undertake. Scope </p><p> The book contains 16 chapters grouped into four major parts: fundamentals, data structures, sorting, and searching. The descriptions here are intended to give readers an understanding of the basic properties of as broad a range of fundamental algorithms as possible. The algorithms described here have found widespread use for years, and represent an essential body of knowledge for both the practicing programmer and the computer-science student. Ingenious methods ranging from binomial queues to patricia tries are described, all related to basic paradigms at the heart of computer science. The second volume consists of four additional parts that cover strings, geometry, graphs, and advanced topics. My primary goal in developing these books has been to bring together the fundamental methods from these diverse areas, to provide access to the best methods known for solving problems by computer. </p><p> You will most appreciate the material in this book if you have had one or two previous courses in computer science or have had equivalent programming experience: one course in programming in a high-level language such as C++, Java, or C, and perhaps another course that teaches fundamental concepts of programming systems. This book is thus intended for anyone conversant with a modern programming ivlanguage and with the basic features of modern computer systems. References that might help to fill in gaps in your background are suggested in the text. </p><p> Most of the mathematical material supporting the analytic results is self-contained (or is labeled as beyond the scope of this book), so little specific preparation in mathematics is required for the bulk of the book, although mathematical maturity is definitely helpful. Use in the Curriculum </p><p> There is a great deal of flexibility in how the material here can be taught, depending on the taste of the instructor and the preparation of the students. There is sufficient coverage of basic material for the book to be used to teach data structures to beginners, and there is sufficient detail and coverage of advanced material for the book to be used to teach the design and analysis of algorithms to upper-level students. Some instructors may wish to emphasize implementations and practical concerns; others may wish to emphasize analysis and theoretical concepts. </p><p> I am developing a variety of course materials for use with this book, including slide masters for use in lectures, programming assignments, homework assignments and sample exams, and interactive exercises for students.</p><p> An elementary course on data structures and algorithms might emphasize the basic data structures in Part 2 and their use in the implementations in Parts 3 and 4. A course on design and analysis of algorithms might emphasize the fundamental material in Part 1 and Chapter 5, then study the ways in which the algorithms in Parts 3 and 4 achieve good asymptotic performance. A course on software engineering might omit the mathematical and advanced algorithmic material, and emphasize how to integrate the implementations given here into large programs or systems. A course on algorithms might take a survey approach and introduce concepts from all these areas. </p><p> Earlier editions of this book have been used in recent years at scores of colleges and universities around the world as a text for the second or third course in computer science and as supplemental reading for other courses. At Princeton, our experience has been that the breadth of coverage of material in this book provides our majors with an introduction to computer science that can be expanded upon in later courses on analysis of algorithms, systems programming and theoretical computer science, while providing the growing group of students from other disciplines with a large set of techniques that these people can immediately put to good use. </p><p> The exercises--most of which are new to this edition--fall into several types. Some are intended to test understanding of material in the text, and simply ask readers to work through an example or to apply concepts described in the text. Others involve implementing and putting together the algorithms, or running empirical studies to compare variants of the algorithms and to learn their properties. Still others are a repository for important information at a level of detail that is not appropriate for the text. Reading and thinking about the exercises will pay dividends for every reader. Algorithms of Practical Use </p><p> Anyone wanting to use a computer more effectively can use this book for reference or for self-study. People with programming experience can find information on specific topics throughout the book. To a large extent, you can read the individual chapters in the book independently of the others, although, in some cases, algorithms in one chapter make use of methods from a previous chapter. </p><p> The orientation of the book is to study algorithms likely to be of practical use. The book provides information about the tools of the trade to the point that readers can confidently implement, debug, and put to work algorithms to solve a problem or to provide functionality in an application. Full implementations of the methods discussed are included, as are descriptions of the operations of these programs on a consistent set of examples. </p><p> Because we work with real code, rather than write pseudo-code, you can put the programs to practical use quickly. Program listings are available from the book's home page. You can use these working programs in many ways to help you study algorithms. Read them to check your understanding of the details of an algorithm, or to see one way to handle initializations, boundary conditions, and other awkward situations that often pose programming challenges. Run vithem to see the algorithms in action, to study performance empirically and check your results against the tables in the book, or to try your own modifications. </p><p> When appropriate, empirical and analytic results are presented to illustrate why certain algorithms are preferred. When interesting, the relationship of the practical algorithms being discussed t</p><p> </p><p> <b>Robert Sedgewick</b> is the William O. Baker Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University.

More recently, his research concentrated on global history and particularly on processes of cross-cultural interaction. His book Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York, 1993) examines processes of cultural exchange and religious conversion before the modern era, and his pamphlet Shapes of World History in Twentieth-Century Scholarship (Washington, D.C., 1996) discusses the historiography of world history. His interests included processes of cross-cultural interaction and cultural exchanges in modern times. <br><br> <b>Herbert F. Ziegler</b> is an associate professor of history at the University of Hawai'i. He has taught courses on world history for the last 19 years and is currently the director of the world history program at the University of Hawai'i. For several years, he also served as the book review editor of the 'Journal of World History'. His interest in twentieth-century European social and political history led to the publication of 'Nazi Germany's New Aristocracy (1990)'. He is at present working on a study that explores uncharted aspects of German society, especially the cultural manifestations of humor and satire in the Nazi era. His other current research project focuses on the application of complexity theory to a comparative study of societies and their internal dynamics. <br> <br><b> Heather Streets Salter</b> is Associate Professor of History at Washington State University, where she teaches World History at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

This is the first edition to present the novel as it originally appeared, with indications of the changes Carlyle made to later editions.</p><p>Thomas Carlyle was a Scottish essayist, satirist, and historian, whose work was hugely influential during the Victorian era.<br>"The best student edition now available."--David J.

Arens, <em>University of Texas</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Backpacking with the Saints: Wilderness Hiking as Spiritual Practice</h2><p>Carrying only basic camping equipment and a collection of the world's great spiritual writings, Belden C. Lane embarks on solitary spiritual treks through the Ozarks and across the American Southwest. For companions, he has only such teachers as Rumi, John of the Cross, Hildegard of Bingen, Dag Hammarskj�ld, and Thomas Merton, and as he walks, he engages their writings with the natural wonders he encounters--Bell Mountain Wilderness with S�ren Kierkegaard, Moonshine Hollow with Thich Nhat Hanh--demonstrating how being alone in the wild opens a rare view onto one's interior landscape, and how the saints' writings reveal the divine in nature. <br><br>The discipline of backpacking, Lane shows, is a metaphor for a spiritual journey. Just as the wilderness offered revelations to the early Desert Christians, backpacking hones crucial spiritual skills: paying attention, traveling light, practicing silence, and exercising wonder. Lane engages the practice not only with a wide range of spiritual writings--Celtic, Catholic, Protestant, Buddhist, Hindu, and Sufi Muslim--but with the fascination of other lovers of the backcountry, from John Muir and Ed Abbey to Bill Plotkin and Cheryl Strayed. In this intimate and down-to-earth narrative, backpacking is shown to be a spiritual practice that allows the discovery of God amidst the beauty and unexpected terrors of nature. Adoration, Lane suggests, is the most appropriate human response to what we cannot explain, but have nonetheless learned to love. <br><br>An enchanting narrative for Christians of all denominations, <em>Backpacking with the Saints</em> is an inspiring exploration of how solitude, simplicity, and mindfulness are illuminated and encouraged by the discipline of backcountry wandering, and of how the wilderness itself becomes a way of knowing-an ecology of the soul.<br></p><p><br><strong>Belden C. Lane</strong> is Professor of Theological Studies, American Religion, and History of Spirituality at Saint Louis University. He is the author of T<em>he Solace of Fierce Landscapes: Exploring Desert and Mountain Spirituality</em> and <em>Ravished by Beauty: The Surprising Legacy of Reformed Spirituality</em>.<br><br>"This is a wise and helpful book, probably best read by reconnoitering the terrain quickly, <br>then lingering over sections that seem inviting. The real point, though, is to engage in the contemplative practice that Lane models so well. If backpacking seems out of the question, adopting the practice of spending time in quiet contemplation of nature while reading the book offers a less intense alternative that can still offer rich rewards."--<em>Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology</em><p></p><br>"Belden C. Lane has written a lovely book that seamlessly brings together two rich genres: travel narrative and spiritual memoir. The notion of a spiritual journey, of course, is central to almost every religious tradition, but the author enlivens that tradition as he shares personal and heartfelt stories about his own peregrinations and muses on topics as varied as solitude, ecology, backpacking, beauty, and prayer; and on people as varied as St. Th�r�se of Lisieux, Dag Hammarskj�ld, John Muir, and Bruce Springsteen. A thoroughly delightful book." --James Martin, SJ, author of <em>Jesus: A</em> <em>Pilgrimage</em><p></p><br>"If the earlier centuries of Christianity had been as honest, emotionally descriptive, and spiritually helpful as Belden Lane is here, we would have a very different notion of religion today. Such wisdom as this will literally 'save the soul' of many a spiritual seeker." --Fr. Richard Rohr, O.F.M., Founder, Center for Action and Contemplation, Albuquerque, New Mexico<p></p><br>"The only problem with this remarkable book is that it cannot be read rightly from a comfortable chair. As Lane and the rest of the saints in these pages insist, what the soul most needs is not found in safe places but in wild ones, where the dangers are as real as the courage they call forth. So find a high rock, a far hill, or a patch of desert that scares you a little and let this book persuade you that you are exactly where you need to be." --Barbara Brown Taylor, author of <em>Learning to Walk in the Dark</em><p></p><br>"The carefully balanced writing about landscape, physical demands, spiritual awakening and literary companionship allows the reader to see, feel, and join in the meditation." --<em>Booklist</em> <br><p></p><br>"Lane's work blends genres, combining the literature of the outdoors with the formal literature of the spiritual as he reviews the work of the world's prominent religious and spiritual writers and ties their insights to the features and experiences of exploring the natural world." --<em>Publishers</em> <em>Weekly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Oxford Annotated Apocrypha: The Apocrypha of the Old Testament</h2><p>Oxford Annotated Apocrypha: The Apocrypha of the Old Testament</p><p></p><h2>Essentials of Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy</h2><p><p>Based on best practices prescribed in <i>The Guide to Physical Therapist Practice,</i> <b>Essentials of Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy, 3rd Edition </b>provides comprehensive coverage of anatomy and physiology, assessment, and aspects of the cardiopulmonary systems, with a focus on their interaction.

Lundbom explores the contours of prophetic speech in ancient Israel. He surveys the elements of each prophet&#39;s message, describes the characteristics of prophetic rhetoric and symbolic behavior, and discusses the problem of authenticity: how did individuals make the claim to speak as prophets, and how did their audiences recognize their claims? The Words of the Prophets offers an authoritative introduction to the phenomenon of ancient prophetic speech for the contemporary reader - and hearer.</p><p>Jack R. Lundbom is Distinguished Visiting Scholar teaching Old Testament at Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg and the author of the three-volume commentary Jeremiah (1999-2004) and Jeremiah: A Study in Ancient Hebrew Rhetoric (1997)."A fresh look at the Hebrew prophets inspired by the issues of modern times, cast within the prism of Judeo-Christian scholarly traditions, Lundbom's reassessment of the biblical text represents a critical resource for students of the Bible and laymen alike." --Seymour Gitin, Dorot Director and Professor of Archaeology<br><br>"Already well-respected for his commentary work on Jeremiah, Lundbom now turns his hand, in more introductory fashion, to the whole canon of Hebrew prophets. He asks what they had in common as prophets and what distinguishes them as individuals. This thorough introductory overview draws out the rhetoric, signs, and symbols employed by these ancient forthtellers to express their often startling messages and draws important parallels with modern-day preachers and teachers." --Katharine Dell, University of Cambridge<br><br>"A very useful summary of the Hebrew Bible's books of the prophets in a clear, reader-friendly form.

She has been nurturing her love of microbiology since her youth growing up on an Idaho farm where she was first fascinated by tiny creatures she could just barely see swimming in a pond. This interest in the microbial world led to a biology major at Idaho State University, where she worked as a teaching assistant and scientific illustrator for one of her professors. This was the beginning of an avocation that she continues today&#x2015;that of lending her artistic hand to interpretation of scientific concepts. She continued her education at Arizona State University, Occidental College, California Institute of Technology, and California State University. She has taught microbiology and major&#x2019;s biology courses at Pasadena City College for 30 years, during which time she developed new curricula and refined laboratory experiments. She has been an author of, and contributor to, several publications of the William C.

She has also served as a coauthor with Kelly Cowan on the first two editions of Microbiology: A Systems Approach. Kathy continues to make microbiology a major focus of her life and is passionate about conveying the significance and practical knowledge of the subject to students, colleagues, family, friends, and practically anyone who shows interest. In addition to her writing and illustration, she keeps current attending conferences and participating in the American Society for Microbiology and its undergraduate educational programs. She is gratified by the many supportive notes and letters she has received over the years from devotees of microbiology and users of her book. She lives in Altadena, California, with husband Dave Bedrosian, and son David. Whenever she can, she visits her family in Idaho. In her spare time, she enjoys photography, reading true crime books, music, crossword puzzles, and playing with her rescued kitties.</p><h2>Reading and Writing About Literature: A Portable Guide</h2><p><p>PACKAGE THIS TITLE WITH OUR 2016 MLA SUPPLEMENT, Documenting Sources in MLA Style (package ISBN-13: 9781319087340).

Here, in "The Land of Counterpane" and "The Land of Nod," and in such delightful lyrics as "My Bed Is a Boat," "Autumn Fires" and "Windy Nights," are rhymes and images children and their parents have cherished together since <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i> was first published in 1885.<br>Alternately humorous and whimsical, grave and fearful, courageous and determined, the poems touchingly voice the many moods and currents of a child's imaginings. All sixty-four poems are reprinted in this edition in large, easy-to-read type. New illustrations by Thea Kliros capture the magical spirit of this beloved classic of children's literature.</p><p><blockquote><i> "The world is so full of a number of things, I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings."</i> </blockquote><p> With this "Happy Thought," Robert Louis Stevenson speaks for all the delights of childhood. But he doesn't stop there. <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>, written over a century ago, is filled to the brim with what are usually considered to be the first real poems written for children. This classic volume is an old friend to the generations of readers who were brought up on "I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me/ And what can be the use of him is more than I can see." In this perfectly lovely edition, the gossamer art of Jessie Willcox Smith (who first illustrated Stevenson's poems in the early years of the 20th century) is reproduced in all its charming glory. Black and white drawings throughout and eight full-page, warmly colorful paintings show beautiful, yet pleasantly imperfect children, busy at their daily activities--climbing trees, watching their reflections in a river, or sick in bed with an army of toy soldiers on guard. Place this on the shelf next to Mother Goose, Dr. Seuss, and Peter Rabbit. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>First published in 1885, Stevenson&#39;s verses so truly reflect the feelings of young children--about being small, the bliss of going up in a swing so high, discovering one&#39;s shadow, happiness and sorrow and dreaming--that they have never ceased to be an essential part of a child&#39;s library. Robinson&#39;s beautiful pictures originally appeared in 1896 in the first illustrated edition.</p><h2>Corrective Reading Decoding Level B2, Teacher Guide (CORRECTIVE READING DECODING SERIES)</h2><p>No Corrective Reading Decoding B2 - Additional Teacher&#39;s Guide Read a customer review or write one .</p><p></p><h2>Human Biology and Health (Prentice Hall Science)</h2><p>Human Biology and Health Book.</p><p></p><h2>The Adventures of Pinocchio (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The story of the wooden puppet who learns goodness and becomes a real boy is famous the world over, and has been familiar in English for over a century.

It&#39;s clear descriptions of timeless fundamental principles make Chow a classic. Anyone wanting to learn, to teach, and to work with water and fluids must own a copy. Open-Channel Hydraulics deals with the design for flow in open channels and their related structures. Covering both theory and practice, it attempts to bridge the gap that generally exists between the two. Theory is introduced first and is then applied to design problems. In many cases the application of theory is illustrated with practical examples. Theory is frequently simplified by adopting theoretically less rigorous treatments with sound concepts, by avoiding use of advanced mathematical manipulations, or by replacing such manipulations with practical numerical procedures. To facilitate understanding of the subject matter, the treatment is mostly based on the condition of one- or two-dimensional flow. The book deals mainly with American practice but also includes related information from many countries throughout the world. Material is divided into five main sections for an orderly and logical treatment of the subject: Basic Principles. Uniform Flow, Varied Flow, Rapidly Varied Flow, and Unsteady Flow. There are 67 illustrative examples, 282 illustrations, 319 problems, and 810 references. This classic textbook was the first English-language book on the subject in two decades. Open-Channel Hydraulics is a valuable text for students of engineering mechanics. hydraulics. civil. agricultural. sanitary. and mechanical engineering, and a helpful compendium for practicing engineers.</p><p>Dr. Ven Te Chow was a Professor of Hydraulic Engineering and led the hydraulic engineering research and teaching programs at the University of Illinois. Through many years of experience as a teacher, engineer, researcher, writer. lecturer, and consultant, he became an internationally recognized leader in the fields of hydraulics, hydrology and hydraulic engineering. Dr. Ven Te Chow authored two technical books and more than 60 articles and papers in scientific an engineering magazines and journals.

Dunning Prize and the Organization of American Historians' Ellis W. Hawley Prize.</strong></i><br><b><br>A sweeping, five-decade history of the evangelical movement in southern California that explains an epochal realignment of American politics.</b><b><b><br><i>From Bible Belt to Sun Belt</i> tells the dramatic and largely unknown story of "plain-folk" religious migrants: hardworking men and women from Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas who fled the Depression and came to California for military jobs during World War II. Investigating this fiercely pious community at a grassroots level, Darren Dochuk uses the stories of religious leaders, including Billy Graham, as well as many colorful, lesser-known figures to explain how evangelicals organized a powerful political machine. This machine made its mark with Barry Goldwater, inspired Richard Nixon's "Southern Solution," and achieved its greatest triumph with the victories of Ronald Reagan. Based on entirely new research, the manuscript has already won the prestigious Allan Nevins Prize from the Society of American Historians. The judges wrote, "Dochuk offers a rich and multidimensional perspective on the origins of one of the most far-ranging developments of the second half of the twentieth century: the rise of the New Right and modern conservatism." 8 pages of photographs</b></b><b><strong><strong> </strong> </strong></b></p><p><b><strong>Darren Dochuk</strong></b><strong> is Associate Professor in the Humanities at the John C.

But as we see in the Bible, God loves to use messy people!</p> <p>In this six-week study, we will dig into the lives of biblical heroes who were messy people just like us but who were used by God in powerful ways. Together we will examine the stories of five wonderful but messy people and one messy parable character: Rahab, the Prodigal Son, Josiah, Mary, David, and Daniel. From their stories, we will learn how God can use broken people, restore damaged hearts and relationships, give us power to handle our critics, and help us deal with the hard moments of life. Along the way we&#x2019;ll discover that we don&#x2019;t have to just endure messy lives but can actually learn to thrive with God&#x2019;s guidance and help.

(Jake Thompson <i>E News</i>)</p><h2>On the Nature of Things: De rerum natura</h2><p><p>Titus Lucretius Carus was probably born in the early first century B.C., and died in the year 55. Little is known of his life, although two tantalizing bits of gossip were passed on by St. Jerome: that he was poisoned by a madness-inducing aphrodisiac given him by his wife, and that his great poem <i>On the Nature of Things</i> was posthumously edited by Cicero. For the latter assertion, writes Anthony Esolen in his introduction to the present volume, there is little evidence, and none whatsoever for the former.</p><p>What does survive is a masterful poetic work that stands as the greatest exposition of Epicurean philosophy. Writing in the waning days of the Roman Republic&#x2015;as Rome's politics grew individualistic and treacherous, its high-life wanton, its piety introspective and morbid&#x2015;Lucretius sets forth a rational and materialistic view of the world which offers a retreat into a quiet community of wisdom and friendship. </p><p>Even to modern readers, the sweep of Lucretius's observations is remarkable. A careful observer of nature, he writes with an innocent curiosity into how things are put together&#x2015;from the oceans, lands, and stars to a mound of poppy seeds, from the "applause" of a rooster's wings to the human mind and soul. Yet Lucretius is no romantic. Nature is what it is&#x2015;fascinating,purposeless, beautiful, deadly. Once we understand this, we free ourselves of superstitious fears, becoming as human and as godlike as we can be. The poem, then, is about the universe and how human beings ought to live in it. Epicurean physics and morality converge.</p><p>Until now, there has been no adequate English verse translation of Lucretius's work. Anthony Esolen fills that gap with a version that reproduces&#x2015;with remarkable faithfulness&#x2015;the meaning, pace, and tone of the original Latin. </p><p>Here is a book that will introduce a new generation of readers to a thinker whose powers of observation and depth of insight remain fresh to the present day.</p><p>"Esolen has the rare gift of being both a fine poet and a lover of languages. His diction is poetic and natural; he has a fine ear for sound, and the translation benefits greatly from being read aloud&#x2015;as Latin poetry was meant to be. This translation is clear and forceful. It can, and will, be read."&#x2015;Kenneth J. Reckford, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</p></p><p><p>Anthony M.

The textbook explores three important issues: how languages and language change are systematic; how the inner history of a language is profoundly affected by its outer history of political and culural events; and how the English of the past has everywhere left its traces on present-day English. By uncovering the language&#39;s past, one can better use it to communicate as well as speculate about its future use in ever-changing globalized media.</p><p>PHD in linguistics and English from Brown University; taught at U of Edinburgh, Univerisite Paul Valery in Monpelllier, France, and at Huazhon U of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China; recipient of many awards including a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship, a Metcalf Award for Excellence in Teaching, and a Humanities Foundation grant.

The second part works out the central tragedy of the saga, while the third describes the retribution wrought by Flosi and Kari. The saga is remarkable not only for the details of everyday life - the farming, the feasting and the charcoal-burning - but also for the social structure of the society in which that life took place - the Althing or Parliament, the lawmaking and the lawgiving.

Lauren Collins discovered this firsthand when, in her early thirties, she moved to London and fell for a Frenchman named Olivier&#x2014;a surprising turn of events for someone who didn&#x2019;t have a passport until she was in college. But what does it mean to love someone in a second language? Collins wonders, as her relationship with Olivier continues to grow entirely in English. Are there things she doesn&#x2019;t understand about Olivier, having never spoken to him in his native tongue? Does &#x201c;I love you&#x201d; even mean the same thing as &#x201c;je t&#x2019;aime&#x201d;? When the couple, newly married, relocates to Francophone Geneva, Collins&#x2014;fearful of one day becoming "a Borat of a mother" who doesn&#x2019;t understand her own kids&#x2014;decides to answer her questions for herself by learning French. <br><br> <i>When in French</i>&nbsp;is a laugh-out-loud funny and surprising memoir about the lengths we go to for love, as well as an exploration across culture and history into how we learn languages&#x2014;and what they say about who we are. Collins grapples with the complexities of the French language, enduring excruciating role-playing games with her classmates at a Swiss language school and accidently telling her mother-in-law that she&#x2019;s given birth to a coffee machine. In learning French, Collins must wrestle with the very nature of French identity and society&#x2014;which, it turns out, is a far cry from life back home in North Carolina. Plumbing the mysterious depths of humanity&#x2019;s many forms of language, Collins describes with great style and wicked humor the frustrations, embarrassments, surprises, and, finally, joys of learning&#x2014;and living in&#x2014;French.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of September 2016:</strong> Lauren Collins was an expat from North Carolina, living in London, when she met and fell in love with the man who would eventually become her husband. Olivier hailed from France (in case the name didn&#x2019;t give that away), and <em>When in French</em> chronicles Collins&#x2019;s fascinating and often hilarious journey learning his native tongue. Along the way she discovers that this endeavor isn&#x2019;t a simple matter of translating &#x201c;I love you&#x201d; to &#x201c;je t'aime,&#x201d; for example, and adding an enthusiastic haw-haw! at the end. In America, the meaning of love is vast. We are just as likely to express our extreme ardor for our partners as we are a bag of Cheetos. For Olivier, this sort of impreciseness was infuriating, which pointed to an important cultural difference that required careful negotiation. To say that <em>When in French</em> is mainly a meditation on language would be accurate (which I&#x2019;m sure Olivier would appreciate). But that description makes it sound as boring as evidently Geneva is, and this memoir is anything but. You will laugh, you might even get misty-eyed, vous allez l'adorer. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Lauren Collins</b>&nbsp;began working at <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>New Yorker</i>&nbsp;in 2003 and became a staff writer in 2008.

Now, dynamically, in a tale of family honor and undying vengeance, of high adventure and heroic derring-do, <em>The Last Cavalier</em> fills that gap. <br> <br>The last cavalier is also Count Hector de Sainte-Hermine, who for three years has been languishing in prison when, in 1804, on the eve of Napoleon's coronation as emperor of France, he learns what's to be his due. Stripped of his title and denied the hand of the woman he loves, he is freed by Napoleon on the condition that he serve as a common foot soldier in the imperial army. So it is in profound despair that Hector embarks on a succession of daring escapades. Again and again he wins glory-against brigands, bandits, the British; boa constrictors, sharks, croco-diles. And at the battle of Trafalgar it's his marksman's bullet that fells the famed English admiral Lord Nelson. <br> <br>Yet however far his adventures may take him-from Burma's jungles to the wilds of Ireland-his destiny lies always in Paris, with his father's enemy, Napoleon.</p><p>One of the most famous French writers of the nineteenth century, Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870) first achieved success in the literary world a playwright, before turning his hand to writing novels. In two years from 1844 to 1855, he published two enormous books, The Count of Monte-Cristo and The Three Muskateers. Both novels have sold millions of copies worldwide.Reviewed by Muchael Dirda<p>Back when I was about 11 or 12, I read The Count of Monte Cristo in a highly abridged children's edition. This "Golden Picture Classic" -- which lies before me, somewhat tattered, as I write -- was (and is) an oversized paperback, priced at 50 cents. Though little more than a pr�cis of the actual novel, which in my French edition requires 1,500 dense pages and two fat volumes, this cheap throwaway, printed on the pulpiest of papers, marked a watershed in my young life. The Hound of the Baskervilles might have been more spookily atmospheric, Journey to the Center of the Earth more wondrous, and King Solomon's Mines arguably more adventure-filled, but for page-turning narrative excitement The Count of Monte Cristo was unbeatable. I read the book over and over. I have never forgotten it. </p><p>But then, no one ever does. Its theme -- self-transformation -- is particulary appealing to the American psyche. A simple sailor, Edmond Dant�s, is framed by those he trusted and sentenced to life in solitary confinement on the Ch�teau d'If. There he unexpectedly encounters a fellow prisoner, the Abb� Faria, who instructs him in languages, manners, swordsmanship and all that a gentleman needs to know. Then, after 15 years, Dant�s finally escapes, retrieves a fabulous treasure and spends yet another nine years further preparing himself for his revenge. When he re-emerges on the stage of Europe after nearly 25 years, it is no longer as a naive young innocent but as the mysterious and implacable Count of Monte Cristo.</p><p> This basic plot -- the stuff of night-school classes and daydreams -- can be seen everywhere, in the lives of self-made men ("I will prepare myself and some day my chance will come" -- Abraham Lincoln), in literary classics such as The Great Gatsby and in Hollywood blockbusters such as "The Mask of Zorro." Yet this novel may not even be Dumas's finest work. That honor arguably belongs to The Three Musketeers, the greatest swashbuckler of them all, packed with political intrigue, derring-do, hell-for-leather horse rides and flashing swords. Its heroes -- Athos, Porthos and Aramis -- soar above the petty concerns of this corrupt and contemptible world: They are pure spirits of the masculine, full of bawdy, gorgeous life, eating, drinking, fighting and making love with Rabelaisian gusto and no thought of the morrow. Just as they enchanted young d'Artagnan, so they enchant us to this day.</p><p>Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870) was himself just such a larger-than-life figure -- as was his father. An illegitimate mulatto of Herculean strength, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas rose from the ranks to become a general and, for a time, Napoleon's rival. But he died relatively young, leaving his family destitute. Despite only the most elementary education, Alexandre nonetheless made the Dumas name world-famous, first as the most popular French playwright of the early 19th century and then as a novelist to rival Walter Scott. With the help of research assistants, this literary dynamo produced an astonishing 300 volumes, many of them historical novels intended to convey the sweep of French history from the Renaissance to the 19th century. Oddly, though, Dumas never seems to have written a full-fledged work covering the crucial Napoleonic era.</p><p>Or so it was believed until Claude Schopp -- France's pre-eminent Dumas scholar -- discovered that, during the very last year of his life, the novelist, though ill, suffering and out of critical favor, had somehow turned out a daily newspaper serial about "the adventures of Count Sainte-Hermine in the age of Napoleon." Because of Dumas's death, the novel was never finished and consequently never published in book form. So Schopp assembled all the newspaper installments and edited them. Le Chevalier de Sainte-Hermine appeared in France in 2005 and is now brought out in an excellent English translation by Lauren Yoder as The Last Cavalier. It's absolutely wonderful.</p><p>Yes, it's full of melodrama and coincidence, shamelessly studded with every possible romantic clich� and period flourish, and old-fashioned enough in its storytelling to wander into lengthy historical and biographical digressions. What's more, we only possess the first third or so of the original mammoth saga envisioned by its author. (A letter exists outlining the entire plot.) No matter. As a boy I could never stop reading Dumas, and, despite the intervening decades, that's still the case: I finished The Last Cavalier in a day. </p><p>Because of its scope, the book actually incorporates a handful of short novels and stories, some told in flashbacks. The first several hundred pages focus on Napoleon's consolidation of power, from just after the Egyptian campaign of 1799 to the discovery of the Cadoudal conspiracy in 1804. The novel announces this theme in its very opening sentence: " 'Now that we are in the Tuileries,' Bonaparte, the First Consul, said to Bourrienne, his secretary, as they entered the palace where Louis XVI had made his next-to-last stop between Versailles and the scaffold, 'we must try to stay.' "</p><p>At first The Last Cavalier seems almost light-hearted -- Josephine is so embarrassed by her shopping bills that she's afraid to tell Bonaparte -- but it darkens soon enough. In particular, we learn about the Saint-Hermine family of Bourbon loyalists. During the 1790s, first the father, and then his two eldest sons, die combating the new regime. The second son actually becomes a kind of Robin Hood, leader of the Companions of Jehu, who rob the government and support those fighting for the royal family, especially the Chouans. These native Bretons act like Indians out of James Fenimore Cooper: They snipe at the army regiments, fade away into the forests and communicate with owl hoots and bird whistles. Their leader, George Cadoudal, is courageous, noble, a true man of honor. But he is ultimately entangled in the webs of Napoleon's spymaster, Joseph Fouch�, perhaps the most intriguing figure in The Last Cavalier -- ugly, coldly intelligent, ruthless and the only man Napoleon fears. Yet while his incessant plotting recalls Cardinal Richelieu in The Three Musketeers, he sometimes functions as a kind of Abb� Faria in his worldly-wise counsel to the young Hector de Sainte-Hermine. </p><p>Hector, the third and last son of his family, is oath-bound to carry on the battle for the Bourbon restoration. But circumstances lead to his being temporarily released from this vow, and he begins to dream of a happy, peaceful life. Deeply in love with Claire de Sourdis, he finds his love returned, and their marriage is soon planned. But at the very moment when Hector is to sign the marriage certificate, a messenger bursts into the room and insists that he step outside for a moment. The bridegroom never reappears. The Companions of Jehu have been unexpectedly reactivated. Hector, as honorable as his namesake, must obey their summons. And so, the witch's dread prophecy to Claire begins its fulfillment: "For fourteen years you will be the widow of a man who is still alive, and the rest of your life the wife of a dead man."</p><p>If it seems I've told a lot of the novel, trust me that I have merely described the arc of its action. There are dramatic individual stories galore -- the heroic martyrdoms of the Saint-Hermines, a magnificent battle between the Chouans and their enemies, the patient revenge of a beautiful woman, the shrewd detective work of the spy called Le Limousin who inexorably tracks down the would-be assassins of Napoleon and, best of all, the close-up portrait of the First Consul himself, a man utterly sure of his destiny.</p><p> At the cliff-hanger end of the first half of The Last Cavalier, Hector is awaiting execution. But Fouch�, for reasons that puzzle even the spymaster, decides to save the young man. Imprisoned like Edmond Dant�s, our hero reads and studies, exercises and develops his mind and body to perfection. After three years, Fouch� then releases him but only on condition that he become a common sailor or soldier. Hector, taking the arch-romantic name of Ren�, agrees to fight for France and ships out on a corsair that preys on English ships. He hopes only to die in action.</p><p>After adventures with storms, Malay pirates, tigers and pythons, not to overlook the battle of Trafalgar and a romantic interlude as tearful and overwrought as any in Chateaubriand, the Comte Sainte-Hermine again falls from grace. In the third part of the novel, he reappears as a soldier in Italy, where he tracks down bandits, wins the esteem of officers and peasants and captures the heart of every woman who sees him. And here, apart from a short fragment, The Last Cavalier breaks off.</p><p>As is fairly evident, Dumas intended Hector to be our viewpoint figure at many of the major theaters of war during the Napoleonic era. In this respect, he is a Gallic equivalent to Sharpe, the English soldier in Bernard Cornwell's admired modern novels about this same period. Though The Last Cavalier may be corny at times and is obviously padded in places (it includes a complete short biography of Gen. Hugo, the father of the poet Victor Hugo), such flaws hardly matter: These 800 pages almost turn themselves. Alexandre Dumas remains, now as ever, the Napoleon of storytellers. </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

Sunlight darkened his fair shoulders on the riverbank as he bathed, performed the holy ablutions, the holy sacrifices. Shade poured into his dark eyes in the mango grove as he played with the other boys, listened to his mother&#x2019;s songs, performed the holy sacrifices, heard the teachings of his learned father and the wise men&#x2019;s counsels. Siddhartha had long since begun to join in the wise men&#x2019;s counsels, to practice with Govinda the art of wrestling with words, to practice with Govinda the art of contemplation, the duty of meditation. He had mastered Om, the Word of Words, learned to speak it soundlessly into himself while drawing a breath, to speak it out soundlessly as his breath was released, his soul collected, brow shining with his mind&#x2019;s clear thought. He had learned to feel Atman&#x2019;s presence at the core of his being, inextinguishable, one with the universe.<br><br> Joy leaped into his father&#x2019;s heart at the thought of his son, this studious boy with his thirst for knowledge; he envisioned him growing up to be a great wise man and priest, a prince among Brahmins.<br><br> Delight leaped into his mother&#x2019;s breast when she beheld him, watched him as he walked and sat and stood, Siddhartha, the strong handsome boy walking on slender legs, greeting her with flawless grace.<br><br> Love stirred in the hearts of the young Brahmin girls when Siddhartha walked through the streets of their town with his radiant brow, his regal eye, his narrow hips.<br><br> But none of them loved him more dearly than Govinda, his friend, the Brahmin&#x2019;s son. He loved Siddhartha&#x2019;s eyes and his sweet voice, loved the way he walked and the flawless grace of his movements; he loved all that Siddhartha did and all he said and most of all he loved his mind, his noble, passionate thoughts, his ardent will, his noble calling. Govinda knew: This would be no ordinary Brahmin, no indolent pen pusher overseeing the sacrifices, no greedy hawker of incantations, no vain, shallow orator, no wicked, deceitful priest, and no foolish, good sheep among the herd of the multitude. Nor did he, Govinda, have any intention of becoming such a creature, one of the tens of thousands of ordinary Brahmins. His wish was to follow Siddhartha, the beloved, splendid one. And if Siddhartha should ever become a god, if he were ever to take his place among the Radiant Ones, Govinda wished to follow him, as his friend, his companion, his servant, his spear bearer, his shadow.<br><br> Thus was Siddhartha beloved by all. He brought them all joy, filled them with delight.<br><br> To himself, though, Siddhartha brought no joy, gave no delight. Strolling along the rosy pathways of the fig garden, seated in the blue-tinged shade of the Grove of Contemplation, washing his limbs in the daily expiatory baths, performing sacrifices in the deep-shadowed mango wood, with his gestures of flawless grace, he was beloved by all, a joy to all, yet was his own heart bereft of joy. Dreams assailed him, and troubled thoughts&#x2014;eddying up from the waves of the river, sparkling down from the stars at night, melting out of the sun&#x2019;s rays; dreams came to him, and a disquiet of the soul wafting in the smoke from the sacrifices, murmuring among the verses of the Rig-Veda, welling up in the teachings of the old Brahmins.<br><br> Siddhartha had begun to harbor discontent. He had begun to feel that his father&#x2019;s love and the love of his mother, even the love of his friend Govinda, would not always and forever suffice to gladden him, content him, sate him, fulfill him. He had begun to suspect that his venerable father and his other teachers, all wise Brahmins, had already given him the richest and best part of their wisdom, had already poured their plenty into his waiting vessel, yet the vessel was not full: His mind was not content, his soul not at peace, his heart restless. The ablutions were good, but they were only water; they could not wash away sin, could not quench his mind&#x2019;s thirst or dispel his heart&#x2019;s fear. The sacrifices and the invocations of the gods were most excellent&#x2014;but was this all? Did the sacrifices bring happiness? And what of the gods? Was it really Prajapati who had created the world? Was it not rather Atman, He, the Singular, the One and Only? Weren&#x2019;t the gods mere shapes, creations like you and me, subject to time, transitory? And was it then good, was it proper, was it meaningful, a noble act, to sacrifice to the gods? To whom else should one sacrifice, to whom else show devotion, if not to Him, the Singular, Atman? And where was Atman to be found, where did He reside, where did His eternal heart lie beating? Where else but within oneself, in the innermost indestructible core each man carries inside him. But where, where was this Self, this innermost, utmost thing? It was not flesh and bone, it was not thought and not consciousness, at least according to the wise men&#x2019;s teachings. Where was it then, where? To penetrate to this point, to reach the Self, oneself, Atman&#x2014;could there be any other path worth seeking? Yet this was a path no one was showing him; it was a path no one knew, not his father, not the teachers and wise men, not the holy songs intoned at the sacrifices! They knew everything, these Brahmins and their holy books, everything, and they had applied themselves to everything, more than everything: to the creation of the world, the origins of speech, of food, of inhalation and exhalation; to the orders of the senses, the deeds of the gods&#x2014;they knew infinitely many things&#x2014;but was there value in knowing all these things without knowing the One, the Only thing, that which was important above all else, that was, indeed, the sole matter of importance?<br><br> To be sure, many verses in the holy books, above all the Upanishads of the Sama-Veda, spoke of this innermost, utmost thing: splendid verses. &#x201c;Your soul is the entire world&#x201d; was written there, and it was written as well that in sleep, the deepest sleep, man entered the innermost core of his being and dwelt in Atman. There was glorious wisdom in these verses; all the knowledge of the wisest men was collected here in magic words, pure as the honey collected by bees. It was not to be disregarded, this massive sum of knowledge that had been collected here by countless generations of wise Brahmins.<br><br> But where were the Brahmins, where the priests, where the wise men or penitents who had succeeded not merely in knowing this knowledge but in living it? Where was the master who had been able to transport his own being-at-home-in-Atman from sleep to the waking realm, to life, to all his comings and goings, his every word and deed?<br><br> Siddhartha knew a great many venerable Brahmins, above all his father, a pure, learned, utterly venerable man. Worthy of admiration was his father, still and regal his bearing, his life pure, his words full of wisdom; fine and noble thoughts resided in his brow. But even he, who was possessed of such knowledge, did he dwell in bliss, did he know peace? Was not he too only a seeker, a man tormented by thirst? Was he not compelled to drink again and again from the holy springs, a thirsty man drinking in the sacrifices, the books, the dialogues of the Brahmins? Why must he, who was without blame, wash away sin day after day, labor daily to cleanse himself, each day anew? Was not Atman within him? Did not the ancient source of all springs flow within his own heart? This was what must be found, the fountainhead within one&#x2019;s own being; you had to make it your own! All else was searching, detour, confusion.<br><br> Such was the nature of Siddhartha&#x2019;s thoughts; this was his thirst, this his sorrow.<br><br> Often he recited to himself the words of a Chandogya Upanishad: &#x201c;Verily, the name of the Brahman is Satyam; truly, he who knows this enters each day into the heavenly world.&#x201d; It often seemed near at hand, this heavenly world, but never once had he succeeded in reaching it, in quenching that final thirst. And of all the wise and wisest men he knew and whose teachings he enjoyed, not a single one had succeeded in reaching it, this heavenly world; not one had fully quenched that eternal thirst.<br><br> &#x201c;Govinda,&#x201d; Siddhartha said to his friend. &#x201c;Govinda, beloved one, come under the banyan tree with me; let us practice samadhi.&#x201d;<br><br> To the banyan they went and sat down beneath it, Siddhartha here and Govinda at a distance of twenty paces. As he sat down, ready to speak the Om, Siddhartha murmured this verse:<br><br> &#x201c;Om is the bow; the arrow is soul.<br><br> Brahman is the arrow&#x2019;s mark;<br><br> Strike it with steady aim.&#x201d;<br><br> When the usual time for the meditation exercise had passed, Govinda arose. Evening had come; it was time to begin the ablutions of the eventide. He called Siddhartha&#x2019;s name; Siddhartha gave no answer. Siddhartha sat rapt, his eyes fixed unmoving upon a far distant point; the tip of his tongue stuck out from between his teeth; he seemed not to be breathing. Thus he sat, cloaked in samadhi, thinking Om, his soul an arrow on its way to Brahman.<br><br> One day, Samanas passed through Siddhartha&#x2019;s town: ascetic pilgrims, three gaunt lifeless men, neither old nor young, with bloody, dust-covered shoulders, all but naked, singed by the sun, shrouded in isolation, foreign to the world and hostile to it, strangers and wizened jackals among men. The hot breath of air that followed them bore the scent of silent passion, a duty that meant destruction, the merciless eradication of ego.<br><br> In the evening, when the hour of contemplation had passed, Siddhartha said to Govinda, &#x201c;Tomorrow morning, my friend, Siddhartha will go to the Samanas. He will become a Samana.&#x201d;<br><br> Govinda turned pale when he heard these words and saw in his friend&#x2019;s impassive face a resolve as unwavering as an arrow shot from the bow. At once, with a single glance, Govinda realized: Now it is beginning, now Siddhartha is on his way, now his destiny is beginning to bud and, along with it, mine as well. And he turned as pale as a dried-out banana peel.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, Siddhartha,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;will your father permit this?&#x201d;<br><br> Siddhartha glanced over at him like a man awakening. Swift as an arrow he read Govinda&#x2019;s soul, read the fear, read the devotion.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, Govinda,&#x201d; he said softly, &#x201c;let us not squander words. Tomorrow at daybreak I begin the life of a Samana. Speak no more of it.&#x201d;<br><br> Siddhartha went into the room where his father was seated upon a mat made of bast fiber; he came up behind him and remained standing there until his father felt there was someone behind him. &#x201c;Is that you, Siddhartha?&#x201d; the Brahmin said. &#x201c;Then say what you have come here to say.&#x201d;<br><br> Said Siddhartha, &#x201c;With your permission, my father. I have come to tell you that it is my wish to leave your house tomorrow and join the ascetics. I must become a Samana. May my father not be opposed to my wish.&#x201d;<br><br> The Brahmin was silent and remained silent so long that the stars drifted in the small window and changed their shape before the silence in the room reached its end. Mute and motionless stood the son with his arms crossed, mute and motionless upon his mat sat the father, and the stars moved across the sky. Then the father said, &#x201c;It is not fitting for a Brahmin to utter sharp, angry words. But my heart is filled with displeasure. I do not wish to hear this request from your lips a second time.&#x201d;<br><br> Slowly the Brahmin rose to his feet. Siddhartha stood in silence with his arms crossed.<br><br> &#x201c;Why do you wait here?&#x201d; the father asked.<br><br> &#x201c;You know why I wait,&#x201d; Siddhartha replied.<br><br> Full of displeasure, the father left the room; full of displeasure, he went to his bed and lay down.<br><br> An hour later, as no sleep would enter his eyes, the Brahmin got up, paced back and forth, and went out of the house. He looked through the small window of the room and saw Siddhartha standing there, his arms crossed, unmoving. The light cloth of his tunic was shimmering pale. His heart full of disquiet, the father went back to bed.<br><br> An hour later, as no sleep would yet enter his eyes, the Brahmin got up once more, paced back and forth, and went out of the house. The moon had risen. He looked through the window into the room; there stood Siddhartha, unmoving, his arms crossed, moonlight gleaming on his bare shins. His heart full of apprehension, the father returned to bed.<br><br> An hour later, and again two hours later, he went out and looked through the small window to see Siddhartha standing there: in the moonlight, in the starlight, in the darkness. He went again from hour to hour, in silence, looked into the room, and saw his son standing there unmoving, and his heart filled with anger, with disquiet, with trepidation, with sorrow.<br><br> And in the last hour of night before day began, he got up once more, went into the room, and saw the youth standing there; he looked tall to him and like a stranger.<br><br> &#x201c;Siddhartha,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;why do you wait here?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You know why.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Will you remain standing here, waiting, until day comes, noon comes, evening comes?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I will remain standing here, waiting.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You will grow tired, Siddhartha.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I will grow tired.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You will fall asleep, Siddhartha.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I will not fall asleep.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You will die, Siddhartha.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I will die.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And you would rather die than obey your father?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Siddhartha has always obeyed his father.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So you will give up your plan?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Siddhartha will do as his father instructs him.&#x201d;<br><br> The first light of day fell into the room. The Brahmin saw that Siddhartha&#x2019;s knees were trembling quietly. In Siddhartha&#x2019;s face he saw no trembling; his eyes gazed into the distance straight before him. The father realized then that Siddhartha was no longer with him in the place of his birth. His son had already left him behind.<br><br> The father touched Siddhartha&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br> &#x201c;You will go,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Go to the forest and be a Samana. If you find bliss in the forest, come and teach it to me. If you find disappointment, return to me and we will once more sacrifice to the gods side by side. Now go and kiss your mother; tell her where you are going. It is time for me to go to the river and begin my first ablutions.&#x201d;<br><br> He took his hand from his son&#x2019;s shoulder and went out. Siddhartha lurched to one side when he tried to walk. Forcing his limbs into submission, he bowed before his father and went to find his mother to do as his father had instructed.<br><br> In the first light of dawn, as he was slowly leaving the town on his stiff legs, a shadow rose up beside the last hut, a shadow that had been crouching there and now joined the pilgrim: Govinda.<br><br> &#x201c;You came,&#x201d; said Siddhartha, and smiled.<br><br> &#x201c;I came,&#x201d; Govinda said.</p><h2>Fluid Mechanics With Engineering Applications</h2><p>This book is well known and well respected in the civil engineering market and has a following among civil engineers.

He describes the all-important creation myth and the role of each member of the Navajo pantheon before revealing the myths and lessons of the People themselves. Line drawings throughout.</p><p>Hausman ( Meditations with the Navajo ) once again turns his storytelling to the Navajo people, this time focusing on their principal "Ways"--ritual pathways whose ancient legends are used to heal, give moral instruction and attain inner harmony, or "walking in beauty." Only a few tales survive today; some of the best known are related here. Part of the Navajo creation myth involving four successive worlds, they all help define and order the Navajo's world and accomplish some sort of transformation. Readers will recognize many familiar characters and themes, such as Mother Earth and the trickster Coyote. The Blessingway includes the story of a man who out-tricks Coyote and a tale of resurrection. The Evil-Chasing Way tells of the encounters of Elder Brother and Younger Brother with the powerful Great Snake. Hausman's decision to retell the tales rather than to record them (as an ethnographer might) proves flawed. While the collection highlights the richness of Navajo spirituality, the voice here is ultimately Hausman's. Hillerman provides a brief but interesting foreword on Navajo theology; Mariah Fox's line drawings of sand paintings add atmosphere. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jane Eyre (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)</h2><p>Adopted at more than 1,000 colleges and universities, Bedford/St. Martin's innovative <i>Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism</i> series has introduced more than a quarter of a million students to literary theory and earned enthusiastic praise nationwide.

In addition, issues can be organized along themes such as social policy, health and education policy, election year issues, international issues, and business issues, or combined with outside content. Guell's 8th edition provides content that is timely and relevant for students, flexible enough to fit any course design.</p><p><p>Dr. Robert C. Guell (pronounced "Gill") is a professor of economics at Indiana State University in Terre Haute, Indiana.

In 1991, he earned a Ph.D. from Syracuse University, where he discovered the thrill of teaching.

Gathered here in superb new renderings by one of the most highly regarded translators of our time&#x2014;versions that have been staged throughout the United States, Canada, and Great Britain&#x2014;are Chekhov&#x2019;s four essential masterpieces for the theater.</p><p>Chekhov's lyrical plays and uproarious farces continue to entertain theatergoers nearly a century after he wrote them. From his early work <i>The Seagull</i> --a depiction of estranged love and thwarted passion that became a great success Stanislavsky's Moscow Art Theater--to his last, <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> --the poignant portrayal of a land-owning family unable to adapt to a changing society--all his plays masterfully combine both levity and pathos. But his comedic genius comes to fruition most fully in his short entertainments, such as the hilarious courtship between a hypochondriac and a shrew depicted in <i>The Proposal</i>. Putting a "slice of life" on stage, Chekhov's dramatic art evokes the painful loneliness of the human condition, yet unfailingly highlights the pretensions and absurdities that make us laugh--at ourselves.&#x201c;Chekhov, speaking simply and never otherwise than as an artist and a humane man, shows us in fullness and plenitude the mystery of our lives.&#x201d;&#x2014;Eudora Welty</p><h2>States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia and China</h2><p>State structures, international forces, and class relations: Theda Skocpol shows how all three combine to explain the origins and accomplishments of social-revolutionary transformations. From France in the 1790s to Vietnam in the 1970s, social revolutions have been rare but undeniably of enormous importance in modern world history. States and Social Revolutions provides a new frame of reference for analyzing the causes, the conflicts, and the outcomes of such revolutions. And it develops in depth a rigorous, comparative historical analysis of three major cases: the French Revolution of 1787 through the early 1800s, the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the 1930s, and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 through the 1960s. Believing that existing theories of revolution, both Marxist and non-Marxist, are inadequate to explain the actual historical patterns of revolutions, the author urges us to adopt fresh perspectives. Above all, she maintains that states conceived as administrative and coercive organizations potentially autonomous from class controls and interests must be made central to explanations of revolutions.</p><p>Why have social revolutions occurred in some countries but not in others? How and why have prerevolutionary regimes come into crisis? This study offers important new theoretical strategies within a comparative historical analysis of the causes and outcomes of three major cases.Theda Skocpol is Victor S.

Polk (The American Presidents Series)</h2><p><p><b>The story of a pivotal president who watched over our westward expansion and solidified the dream of Jacksonian democracy</b></p><p>James K. Polk was a shrewd and decisive commander in chief, the youngest president elected to guide the still-young nation, who served as Speaker of the House and governor of Tennessee before taking office in 1845. Considered a natural successor to Andrew Jackson, "Young Hickory" miraculously revived his floundering political career by riding a wave of public sentiment in favor of annexing the Republic of Texas to the Union. <br> Shortly after his inauguration, he settled the disputed Oregon boundary and by 1846 had declared war on Mexico in hopes of annexing California. The considerably smaller American army never lost a battle. At home, however, Polk suffered a political firestorm of antiwar attacks from many fronts. Despite his tremendous accomplishments, he left office an extremely unpopular man, on whom stress had taken such a physical toll that he died within three months of departing Washington. Fellow Tennessean John Seigenthaler traces the life of this president who, as Truman noted, "said what he intended to do and did it."</p></p><p><b>John Seigenthaler</b> was the founder of the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University. An administrative assistant to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, he was an award-winning journalist for the <i>Nashville Tennessean</i> for forty-three years, finally serving as the paper's editor, publisher, and CEO, and was named founding editorial director of <i>USA Today</i> in 1982.This newest addition to the American Presidents series edited by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. offers a solid portrait of an unlikable man who achieved extraordinary things. A Tennesseean like Polk, Seigenthaler (founding editorial director of USA Today) agrees with those who rate this dour, partisan, grudge-holding, one-term president a success. Polk took office in 1845 with four aims in mind: to lower the tariff, take federal deposits away from private banks, wrest the Oregon territory from joint possession with Great Britain and make California an American territory. In achieving everything he sought, Polk was more successful than most presidents. National sentiment favored him. He was politically skillful. And by declaring that he'd serve for only one term, Polk freed himself to push ahead without his eyes on re-election. But Seigenthaler fails to evaluate the consequences of Polk's successes. His first three goals were reasonably uncontroversial, their effects specific and contained. But his last-to take California from Mexico-ended in war with that nation, ostensibly over Texas. The war brought Texas, California and the entire Southwest into American possession. It also cost Mexico half its territory. More consequentially, it heightened national tensions over slavery and set in motion the bitter events that culminated in civil war. To be sure, those events lie beyond the biography of a man who died long before the Civil War began. But a presidency takes on meaning from its context and consequences. In the end, this biography nicely paints a four-year term, but leaves us wanting an assessment of its significance within the longer span of history.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Horse</h2><p>For undergraduate/graduate animal science or equine studies courses at the levels, <i>The Horse, 2/e</i> provides in-depth discussions of equine biology, nutrition, genetics, reproduction, health, and management--with an emphasis on anatomy and physiology, and the care of legs and feet, that will help students assess injuries.</p><p></p><h2>Helping Abused and Traumatized Children: Integrating Directive and Nondirective Approaches</h2><p>Presenting an integrative model for treating traumatized children, this book combines play, art, and other expressive therapies with ideas and strategies drawn from cognitive-behavioral and family therapy. Eliana Gil demonstrates how to tailor treatment to the needs of each child by using both directive and nondirective approaches. Throughout, practical clinical examples illustrate ways to target trauma-related symptomatology while also helping children process painful feelings and memories that are difficult to verbalize. The book concludes with four in-depth cases that bring to life the unique situation of each child and family, the decision making process of the therapist, and the applications of developmentally informed, creative, and flexible interventions.<br></p><p><p>Eliana Gil, PhD, is founding partner of the Gil Institute for Trauma Recovery and Education, a private group practice in Fairfax, Virginia. She is also Director of Starbright Training Institute for Child and Family Play Therapy. Dr. Gil has worked in the field of child abuse prevention and treatment since 1973.

She is the author of <i>The Healing Power of Play</i>, <i>Helping Abused and Traumatized Children</i>, and <i>Play in Family Therapy, Second Edition</i>, among many other publications. Originally from Guayaquil, Ecuador, Dr. Gil is bilingual and bicultural.</p>"In this book, Eliana Gil skillfully shows how a well-selected repertoire of methods can be flexibly combined and adapted to facilitate the successful treatment of traumatized children. Through excellent, detailed case examples, she demonstrates ways to individualize treatment by attending carefully to the personal meanings and experiences of each child. The cases will be of benefit and interest to professionals experienced in working with children, as well as to students in all of the mental health disciplines. This is an excellent work."--Kathleen Nader, DSW, Austin, Texas&nbsp;"What a refreshing book! In the age of managed care, Gil provides a clear and compelling argument for the importance of experience, compassion, and insight. Clinicians know that each child is unique, and a flexible, multidimensional approach to healing is what we need to be able to provide. Gil discusses how she has drawn from various schools of thought and therapeutic models to build a clinical workshop with many tools, and how she has learned to use the right tool at the right time to help traumatized children. I highly recommend this book to anyone working with children."--Bruce D. Perry, MD, PhD, Senior Fellow, The ChildTrauma Academy; Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University&nbsp;"Gil artfully combines her own experiences as a play therapist with contemporary research findings to provide this practical, interesting guide. Beautifully told accounts of play therapy with young trauma survivors illustrate this thoughtful treatment approach, which integrates cognitive-behavioral, expressive, and family therapies. For practitioners as well as students, this book provides a helpful framework for individualizing treatment to fit the unique needs of each child."--Janine Shelby, PhD, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles<p>"Gil brings more than 30 years of her rich and always evolving clinical wisdom, practice, and experience to this book. She offers us a truly timely and welcome overview of her insights on how to best help abused and traumatized children...Her approach is refreshingly integrative--a seamless blend of cognitive-behavioral therapies with interventions drawn from family, play, and psychodynamic modalities. The overarching emphasis is on the child's uniqueness, inner resources, and situational circumstances.

Yet words also have a nature peculiarly their own. And when discussing them as modes of action, we must consider both this nature as words in themselves and the nature they get from the non-verbal scenes that support their acts. I shall be happy if the reader can say of this book that, while always considering words as acts upon a scene, it avoids the excess of environmentalist schools which are usually so eager to trace the relationships between act and scene that they neglect to trace the structure of the act itself.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Kenneth Burke</b> has been termed "simply the finest literary critic in the world, and perhaps the finest since Coleridge" (Stanley Edgar Hyman, The New Leader).

Piecing together their story from the few contemporary accounts that have survived requires painstaking detective work, but it can render both the past and the present in a new light. Following the lives of influential women across the first centuries of the church, Band of Angels tells the remarkable story of how a new way of understanding relationships took root in the ancient world.&nbsp;As Cooper demonstrates, women from all walks of life played an invaluable role in Christianity's growth to become a world religion. Peasants, empresses, and independent businesswomen contributed what they could to an emotional revolution unlike anything the ancient world had ever seen. By sharing the ideas that had inspired them, ancient women changed their own lives. But they did something more. Their story is a testament to what invisible people can achieve, and to how the power of ideas can change the world, one household at a time.</p><p>Kate Cooper is&nbsp; Professor of Ancient History at the University of Machester. Born in Washington, DC, she was educated at Princeton, Harvard, and Wesletan universities."A distinguished ancient historian&#x2019;s elegant study of the extraordinary women who helped lay the foundations of the early Christian church...Engaging reading for specialists and general readers alike." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>Advance praise for <i>Band of Angels</i>: <br><br> &#x201c;This remarkable book is the best sort of engaged history, looking at familiar texts in new ways, while also revealing unfamiliar personalities and sources covering five centuries of early Christian development. &nbsp;It offers reflection on the meanings for contemporary Christian Churches which emerge from the stories that it tells. &nbsp;It makes an elegant and enjoyable contribution to unravelling centuries of unwarranted assumptions about the role of women in ministry and Christian life.&#x201d; -&#x2014;Diarmaid MacCulloch, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years</i><br><br>"I don't quite know another book like this one...One great gift of this book involves women's agency.

Cooper has presented us with a wide-ranging, informative study. I admire her learning and her guidance, and she knows how to lead an audience. I am especially grateful that she chose to follow the lives of individual women rather than to build an abstract argument." &#x2014;<i>Huffington Post</i></p><h2>A Naked Singularity: A Novel</h2><p><i>A Naked Singularity </i>tells the story of Casi, a child of Colombian immigrants who lives in Brooklyn and works in Manhattan as a public defender--one who, tellingly has never lost a trial. Never. In the book, we watch what happens when his sense of justice and even his sense of self begin to crack--and how his world then slowly devolves. It&#x2019;s a huge, ambitious novel clearly in the vein of DeLillo, Foster Wallace, Pynchon, and even Melville, and it's told in a distinct, frequently hilarious voice, with a striking human empathy at its center. Its panoramic reach takes readers through crime and courts, immigrant families and urban blight, media savagery and media satire, scatology and boxing, and even a breathless heist worthy of any crime novel. If <i>Infinite</i><i>Jest</i> stuck a pin in the map of mid-90s culture and drew our trajectory from there, <i>A Naked Singularity</i> does the same for the feeling of surfeit, brokenness, and exhaustion that permeates our civic and cultural life today. In the opening sentence of William Gaddis&#x2019;s <i>A Frolic of His Own</i>, a character sneers, "Justice? You get justice in the next world. In this world, you get the law." <i>A Naked Singularity</i> reveals the extent of that gap, and lands firmly on the side of those who are forever getting the law.</p><p><p></p><b>Sergio De La Pava</b> is a writer who does not live in Brooklyn.<p></p>"One of the 10 best fiction books of 2012. . . .

It is about a city that teeters on the edge of total collapse and complete disaster, but that has the capacity to right itself (whew!) at the last possible second. . . .

It's the sort of book you write if you're not sure anyone will ever let you write another one. . . . Even while the lives it describes are often bleak, the book is funny, consistently so. . . . The heist is discussed so exhaustively that when it finally transpires it's thrilling. Casi's defendants, all messes, are lovely and authentic. I could have done with a whole book about them, or rather I enjoyed the whole book about them I read in the middle of this much larger book about other things.

But see here: I refuse to divulge too much of the plot, because watching it unfold is one of the great joys of the novel. . . . . What I keep coming back to is the audacity of this novel, which is truly a towering, impressive work--De La Pava's not hesitant to break and then mirror the narrative with the story of professional boxer Wilfred Benitez, or insert a recipe, none of which hinder the narrative but rather shape the entirety of the book, making the actual story and its effect on the characters (and the characters' actions that shape the story, et cetera) more profound. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;If you like <i>The Wire</i>, if you like rewarding, difficult fiction, if you like literary, high-quality artistic and hilarious yet moving novels that are difficult to put down, I can&#x2019;t recommend <i>A Naked Singularity</i> enough."</p> (Scott Bryan Wilson <i>The Quarterly Conversation</i>)<br><br>"<i>A Naked Singularity</i> looks like an unreadable brick, bloated at 700 pages and likely dense with esoterica.

Where do moral standards come from? Are they based on emotions, reason, or some innate sense of right and wrong? For many scientists, the key lies entirely in biology--especially in Darwinian theories of evolution and self-preservation. But if evolution is a struggle for survival, why are we still capable of altruism?</p><br><p> In his classic study <i>The Expanding Circle</i>, Peter Singer argues that altruism began as a genetically based drive to protect one's kin and community members but has developed into a consciously chosen ethic with an expanding circle of moral concern. Drawing on philosophy and evolutionary psychology, he demonstrates that human ethics cannot be explained by biology alone. Rather, it is our capacity for reasoning that makes moral progress possible. In a new afterword, Singer takes stock of his argument in light of recent research on the evolution of morality.</p></p><p><p>"Singer's theory of the expanding circle remains an enormously insightful concept, which reconciles the existence of human nature with political and moral progress. It was also way ahead of its time. . . . It's wonderful to see this insightful book made available to a new generation of readers and scholars."<b>--Steven Pinker, author of <i>The Blank Slate</i> and <i>The Stuff of Thought</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Expanding Circle</i> is a brilliant book whose significance becomes clearer every year.

Here, in Temple Grandin's own words, is the story what it is like to live with autism.&nbsp;&nbsp;Temple is among the few people who have broken through many the neurological impairments associated with autism.&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout her life, she has developed unique coping strategies, including her famous "squeeze machine," modeled after seeing the calming effect squeeze chutes on cattle.&nbsp;&nbsp;She describes her pain isolation growing up "different" and her discovery visual symbols to interpret the "ways of the natives" <i>Thinking in Pictures</i> also gives information from the frontlines of autism, including treatme medication, and diagnosis, as well as Temple's insight into genius, savants, sensory phenomena, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is Temple's unique ability describe the way her visual mind works and how she first made the connection between her impairment and animal temperament that is the basis of extraordinary gift and phenomenal success.</p><p>Oliver Sacks calls Temple Grandin's first book--and the first picture of autism from the inside--"quite extraordinary, unprecedented and, in a way, unthinkable." Sacks told part of her story in his <i>An Anthropologist on Mars</i>, and in <i>Thinking in Pictures</i> Grandin returns to tell her life history with great depth, insight, and feeling. Grandin told Sacks, "I don't want my thoughts to die with me. I want to have done something ... I want to know that my life has meaning ... I'm talking about things at the very core of my existence." Grandin's clear exposition of what it is like to "think in pictures" is immensely mind-broadening and basically destroys a whole school of philosophy (the one that declares language necessary for thought). Grandin, who feels she can "see through a cow's eyes," is an influential designer of slaughterhouses and livestock restraint systems. She has great insight into human-animal relations. It would be mere justice if <i>Thinking in Pictures</i> transforms the study of religious feeling, too.Temple Grandin is currently an assistant professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University.</p><h2>Goodbye to Berlin</h2><p><p><strong>Isherwood's classic story of Berlin in the 1930s - and the inspiration for <em>Cabaret</em> - now in a stand-alone edition.</strong></p> First published in 1934, <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em> has been popularized on stage and screen by Julie Harris in <em>I Am a Camera</em> and Liza Minelli in <em>Cabaret</em>.

Frontier orbital theory looks at how the transition state of an organic reaction is affected by the interaction of the molecular orbitals of the starting materials. It thus complements the more familiar thermodynamic picture of transition states, in which product-like character is seen as influencing the ease and the course of reactions. The theory is presented very simply, without mathematics, stressing physical principles and assuming only that the reader is familiar with the concept of a molecular orbital as a linear combination of atomic orbitals. This book thus makes frontier orbital theory accessible for the first time to readers at every level.

It's easy to understand either pole of opinion about this very American painter, but harder to get to the essence of what makes him excite such vehemence. In the end, it may simply be that he is very, very good, and like all good painters, a little too complicated for most critics. <p> For one thing, while Wyeth does have a special sensitivity for suggestive narrative elements, he is also an abstract painter, with a powerful sense of gesture, stroke, and pattern. Some of his watercolors are as thrusting and liquid as Jackson Pollock's drips, and almost as nonobjective. Other compositions can be as fixed as <i>Christina's World</i>, the huge 1948 painting for which he is perhaps best known, but within the strictly ordered confines of tempera, a painstaking medium, he still handles the brush with bravura. The authors of <i>Unknown Terrain</i> make an attempt to elucidate Wyeth's relationship to this century, and they succeed admirably--with the help of nearly 200 reproductions.</p>With more than 160 reproductions, the lion's share in color, this accompaniment to an exhibition of landscapes by one of the century's greatest serious popular painters is a shoo-in addition to virtually every American art library. Emphasizing landscape, it perforce emphasizes Wyeth's watercolors, which have never before been so extensively displayed. Like many other artists, Wyeth uses watercolor to make preparatory studies for paintings in a classier medium, in his case tempera. More swiftly and impressionistically executed, the watercolor studies are immediately discriminable from the temperas and frequently exemplify one of the four types of realism Adam D. Weinberg's excellent essay descries in the work of this artist, often lazily considered stylistically monotonous. Weinberg also points out that the supposedly retrograde Wyeth's formal concerns are virtually identical with those of his abstract expressionist contemporaries, and Beth Venn invaluably describes Wyeth's watercolor techniques. Michael Kammen, in the book's third and last essay, cogently discusses two qualities that inform Wyeth's art and ensure its American popularity--individualism and local patriotism. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Contemporary Management</h2><p><p><em><b>Contemporary Management</b></em><strong>&nbsp;10e</strong>&nbsp;mirrors the changes taking place in today's management practice by incorporating recent developments in management theory and research.

It builds on recent advances in environmental science, engineering, and geospatial information technologies to provide students with the scientific foundation they need to understand both natural land systems and engineering approaches that can mitigate impacts of land use practices. While offering a base of knowledge in planning theory and natural science, its primary emphasis is on describing and explaining emerging approaches, methods, and techniques for environmental land use planning, design, and policy. The book is divided into two parts. Part I, ""Environmental Land Use Management,"" introduces broad concepts of environmental planning and describes management approaches. Those approaches include collaborative environmental management, land conservation, environmental design, government land use management, natural hazard mitigation, and ecosystem and watershed management. Part II, ""Environmental Land Use Principles and Planning Analysis,"" focuses on land analysis methods, such as geospatial data and geographic information systems (GIS); soils and slope analysis; assessment of stormwater quantity and quality; land use and groundwater protection; ecological assessment for vegetation, wetlands, and habitats; and integrated analytical techniques like land suitability analysis, carrying capacity studies, and environmental impact assessment. <i>Environmental Land Use Planning and Management</i>offers a unique interdisciplinary perspective with an emphasis on application. It is an important new text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in environmental planning, landscape architecture, geography, environmental studies, and natural resource management, and a valuable resource for professionals and others concerned with issues of environmental planning and land use.</p><p><strong>John Randolph</strong> is professor and head of the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia."This is the book that environmental and water planners have been waiting for since the 1969 publication of McHarg's <i>Design With Nature</i>...Randolph has produced a comprehensive text for the modern environmental planner."

To Kathleen Stewart, this particular "other" exists as an excluded subtext to the American narrative of capitalism, modernization, materialism, and democracy. In towns like Amigo, Red Jacket, Helen, Odd, Viper, Decoy, and Twilight, men and women "just settin'" track a dense social imaginary through stories of traumas, apparitions, encounters, and eccentricities. Stewart explores how this rhythmic, dramatic, and complicated storytelling imbues everyday life in the hills and forms a cultural poetics. Alternating her own ruminations on language, culture, and politics with continuous accounts of "just talk," Stewart propels us into the intensity of this nervous, surreal "space on the side of the road." It is a space that gives us a glimpse into a breach in American society itself, where graveyards of junked cars and piles of other trashed objects endure along with the memories that haunt those who have been left behind by "progress."</p><br><p> Like James Agee's portrayal of the poverty-stricken tenant farmers of the Depression South in <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,</i> this book uses both language and photographs to help readers encounter a fragmented and betrayed community, one "occupied" by schoolteachers, doctors, social workers, and other professionals representing an "official" America. Holding at bay any attempts at definitive, social scientific analysis, Stewart has concocted a new sort of ethnographic writing that conveys the immediacy, density, texture, and materiality of the coal camps. <i>A Space on the Side of the Road</i> finally bridges the gap between anthropology and cultural studies and provides us with a brilliant and challenging experiment in thinking and writing about "America."</p></p><p><p>"With its densely textured scanning of the languages people use to explain their lives without explaining them away, [this book] is by far the best [one] written on ordinary language, pain, and desire in the contemporary United States."--<b>Lauren Berlant, University of Chicago</b></p><b>Kathleen Stewart</b> is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Texas, Austin.</p><h2>CONNECTED MATHEMATICS 3 STUDENT EDITION GRADE 6: PRIME TIME: FACTORS ANDMULTIPLES COPYRIGHT 2014</h2><p>CONNECTED MATHEMATICS 3 STUDENT EDITION GRADE 6: PRIME TIME: FACTORS ANDMULTIPLES COPYRIGHT 2014</p><p></p><h2>The Holy Spirit: Activating God&#39;s Power in Your Life</h2><p><p><strong>With prayerful reverence and focused wisdom, Dr. Graham puts an understandable face on this mysterious third Person of the Trinity: The Holy Spirit is "not an impersonal force, like gravity or magnetism.

Jesus simply said, "If I go, I will send Him to you."</p><p>Read this amazing book and see anew how this Person can transform your life and give you the power "to be truly good" and "to live victoriously."</p></p><p><i>The Holy Spirit: Activating God's Power in Your Life</i> by Billy Graham begins with a very simple statement: "Man has two great spiritual needs. One is for forgiveness. The other is for goodness." Graham then affirms that "God heard that first cry for help, that cry for forgiveness, and answered it at Calvary" and that "God also heard our second cry ... and answered it at Pentecost." The Holy Spirit, Graham writes, is "the source of power who meets our need to escape from the miserable weakness that grips us," even after one has given one's life to Christ. "He gives us the power to be truly good." <p> In clear, concise prose, Graham then walks readers through biblical passages that teach about the Holy Spirit. He also describes some related concepts and experiences that are widely misunderstood, such as baptism with the spirit and sins against the Holy Spirit. And he gives readers a solid outline of the signs and fruits of the Spirit (such as love, joy, peace, patience, and kindness). Graham's book may be especially helpful for new Christians, but it will also serve as a helpful reminder to longtime believers. "No person can seek sincerely the cleansing and blessing of the Holy Spirit, and remain the same afterward," Graham promises. This promise is sufficiently grounded in scripture, and offered with such authoritative serenity that many readers will find real comfort here. <i>--Kevin Attwood</i></p>An informative, clarifying, and unifying book on the Holy Spirit <p>Who is the Holy Spirit and what does he do? The world-renowned evangelist Billy Graham offers a sensitive and comprehensive portrait of the much discussed but often-misunderstood member of the Trinity. The Holy Spirit came to empower God&#x2019;s people and transform their lives, yet so often the doctrine of the Holy Spirit causes division in the church. It is crucial to develop a genuinely biblical understand of the Third Person of the Trinity&#x2014;and to experience an authentic outpouring of his power.</p></p><h2>The Jungle (Barnes &amp; Noble Signature Editions)</h2><p>This item condition is New.

A scholar of religious thought and biblical archaeology, James Pritchard recruited the foremost linguists, historians, and archaeologists to select and translate the texts. The goal, in his words, was "a better understanding of the likenesses and differences which existed between Israel and the surrounding cultures." Before the publication of these volumes, students of the Old Testament found themselves having to search out scattered books and journals in various languages. This anthology brought these invaluable documents together, in one place and in one language, thereby expanding the meaning and significance of the Bible for generations of students and readers. As one reviewer put it, "This great volume is one of the most notable to have appeared in the field of Old Testament scholarship this century."</p><br><p> Princeton published a follow-up companion volume, <i>The Ancient Near East in Pictures Relating to the Old Testament</i> (1954), and later a one-volume abridgment of the two, <i>The Ancient Near East: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures</i> (1958). The continued popularity of this work in its various forms demonstrates that anthologies have a very important role to play in education--and in the mission of a university press.</p></p><p>"[A] very useful book, soundly conceived, competently edited, and beautifully printed. It offers in translation texts of the most important documents which throw light on the Near East background of the Old Testament.

A moving, deeply personal journey of survival and discovery that tells of the evolution of a cuisine and of the transformative power and magic of food and cooking.

Bravo." --<b>Joan Nathan, author of </b><b><i>King Solomon's Table</i></b><br><br>Alon Shaya's is no ordinary cookbook. It is a memoir of a culinary sensibility that begins in Israel and wends its way from the U.S.A. (Philadelphia) to Italy (Milan and Bergamo), back to Israel (Jerusalem) and comes together in the American South, in the heart of New Orleans. It's a book that tells of how food saved the author's life and how, through a circuitous path of (cooking) twists and (life-affirming) turns the author's celebrated cuisine--food of his native Israel with a creole New Orleans kick came to be, along with his award-winning New Orleans restaurants: Shaya, Domenica, and Pizza Domenica, ranked by <i>Esquire, Bon App�tit,</i> and others as the best new restaurants in the United States.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are stories of place, of people, and of the food that connects them, a memoir of one man's culinary sensibility, with food as the continuum throughout his journey--guiding his personal and professional decisions, punctuating every memory, choice, every turning point in his life.

It&#x2019;s a perfect moment of simplicity; at the right temperature, olive oil and cheese can be as flawless as anything that costs you far more time, money, or energy. Any brand of soft aged cheese will do&#x2014;I like La Tur, a flawless mixed-milk cheese that&#x2019;s as creamy as goat, with just a little sheep-y funk that&#x2019;s softened by the cow&#x2019;s milk. Have fun with the spices: throw in a couple cloves instead of the star anise, add a sprig of rosemary instead of the bay, or use lemon instead of orange.<br> &nbsp;<br> 8-ounce wheel of soft goat or mixed-milk cheese, like La Tur<br> 3 cloves garlic, unpeeled<br> 1 teaspoon whole allspice berries<br> � teaspoon whole coriander seeds<br> � cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 1 dried �rbol chile or � teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 1 star anise pod<br> Two 1-inch strips of orange peel, divided<br> A crusty baguette<br> Maldon or other flaky sea salt to finish<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Heat the oven to 325F. Put the cheese in the bowl or rimmed plate from which it&#x2019;ll be served so that it can soften. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Use the side of a knife or a rolling pin to lightly crush the garlic, just so it starts to open up in its skin. Lightly crush or roughly chop the allspice and coriander and add them with the garlic to a small ovenproof saucepan along with the olive oil, bay leaves, �rbol chile, star anise, and 1 strip of orange peel. Cover with a lid and bake for 40 to 45 minutes; the garlic will be very golden and the orange rind will have darkened quite a bit. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Once the sauce has come together, remove the saucepan from the oven and increase the heat to 425F. Take the second strip of orange peel and give it a little twist over the pan to release the oil, then drop it into the pan and let the oil cool down. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Cut the baguette on a bias into �-inch slices and arrange them on a baking sheet. Toast at 425F for 6 to 8 minutes, until they&#x2019;ve built some nice color along the edges. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Pour the oil over and around the softened cheese, letting the spices run free, and sprinkle the salt just before serving. Slather the toasts with cheese and encourage your friends to dab up every last drop of the infused oil. <br><b><br><br>Shakshouka&nbsp;</b><br> <b>YIELD: 4 to 6 servings</b><br> Plenty of water, for the Jerusalem artichokes, fava beans, and an ice bath <br> 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons Morton kosher salt, divided <br> � pound Jerusalem artichokes <br> 1 pound fava beans in their shells <br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil&nbsp;<br> 1pint cherry tomatoes, halved <br> 1 small red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced <br> 1 small green bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced <br> 1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced <br> 2 cloves garlic, minced&nbsp;<br> One 28-ounce can peeled whole tomatoes&nbsp;<br> 1 egg per person&nbsp;<br> � cup zhoug (page 395) <br> Eggs poached in a spicy, savory tomato sauce: this dish serves itself. It&#x2019;s my go-to when I show up at someone&#x2019;s house and everyone is hungry. Chances are, there are eggs and a can of tomatoes on hand. Outside of that foundation, you can be as creative or as simple about adding anything else as you like. <br> &nbsp;<br> Jerusalem artichokes, if you&#x2019;ve never had them, taste and feel like a cross between potatoes and artichoke hearts; along with the fava beans, they make this dish special. They do need to be pre- pared separately, but you can do that in advance if it makes your life (and cooking timeline) easier. If you have trouble tracking either ingredient down, substitute any root vegetable&#x2014;turnips, potatoes, even beets&#x2014;for the Jerusalem artichokes, and a cup of shelled fresh or frozen beans, such as limas, for the fava beans. <br> &nbsp;<br> Once you put pan to stove, the rest of the dish comes together quite quickly, so, for the sake of the vegetables&#x2019; flavor and texture, make sure everything is prepped and ready to go. Dress it up or down with your favorite vegetables or meats&#x2014;whatever&#x2019;s on hand&#x2014;along with any herbs and spices you like. Tomatoes are the perfect backdrop. You&#x2019;ll need one egg per person, as few as two or as many as six. Part of the fun is making this dish your own, but one word of advice: try it with the zhoug, a spicy Yemeni green chile sauce, like the Middle Eastern approach to pesto. Its fresh, herbal heat is the perfect finishing touch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Fill a large pot with the water and 1 tablespoon salt, and bring to a boil. Thoroughly scrub the Jerusalem artichokes; if they&#x2019;re large or unevenly sized, cut them into even chunks. Boil for 30 to 35 minutes, until they&#x2019;re about the consistency of a cooked potato, easily pierced with a knife but not falling apart. Drain, and when they&#x2019;re cool enough to handle, slice into little coins. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Fill another pot with water and bring it to a boil; meanwhile, prepare an ice bath. Cook the fava beans for 5 minutes, or until the outer shell puffs up and pulls away from the bean. The water in the pot will turn reddish, but don&#x2019;t freak out&#x2014;that&#x2019;s normal. Shock the beans in the ice bath to stop the cooking, then shell them when they&#x2019;ve cooled down. You should have about 1 cup beans. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Add the olive oil to a large enameled or stainless-steel skillet that has a lid (but don&#x2019;t use the lid just yet). Turn the heat to high, and when the oil is shimmering, pull the skillet off the heat and carefully add the cherry tomatoes; they&#x2019;ll give off&nbsp;a lot of smoke and may splatter. Place the pan back on the heat, and don&#x2019;t stir; you want the tomatoes to char lightly in a few places. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;After a couple of minutes, when the tomatoes are starting&nbsp;to blister, stir in the bell peppers, onion, and garlic.&nbsp;Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes or so, until all the vegetables are a little golden around the edges and the cherry tomatoes are melting into everything else. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Decrease the heat to medium, and add the Jerusalem artichokes, favas, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Roughly crush the canned tomatoes between your fingers, or chop them, and add them to the pan with their juice. Cook the sauce for a couple of minutes, until it thickens slightly. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Decrease the heat to medium-low, and use your spoon to make little divots in the sauce, one per egg. Crack an egg into each, cover the pan, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the egg white is set but the center still jiggles. Dollop a spoonful of zhoug over each egg before serving. <br> &nbsp;<br><b>Tabbouleh with Preserved Lemon and Almonds<br></b><b>YIELD: 4 to 6 servings</b><br> This simplest of salads always surprises people at Shaya. &#x201c;How can parsley salad be so complex?&#x201d; they ask. The answer is twofold: preserved lemon and baharat (page 000). Take the time to find (or make) these ingredients and it will pay off with flavor, although � teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice is a pretty good replica of the baharat and freshly grated lemon zest can stand in for preserved lemon. Bear in mind, tabbouleh is a parsley salad&#x2014;even the bulgur plays a supporting role&#x2014;so it is only as good and fresh as the parsley you get. Find bunches with crisp, bright green leaves at the grocery store or farmer&#x2019;s market.<br> &nbsp;<br> � cup water<br> &#x215b; teaspoon plus 1 teaspoon Morton kosher salt, divided<br> 2 tablespoons bulgur wheat<br> 5 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon minced preserved lemon<br> � teaspoon Baharat (page 000)<br> � teaspoon ground allspice<br> � cup extra-virgin olive oil <br> 2 quarts lightly packed fresh parsley leaves (from about 4 bunches)<br> 1 cup sliced almonds, toasted<br> A quarter of a red onion, finely chopped<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Bring the water to a boil with &#x215b; teaspoon salt (this won&#x2019;t take long since there&#x2019;s so little of it). Put the bulgur in a small heatproof bowl, cover it with the boiling water, and cover with plastic wrap or foil until all the water is absorbed, 15 minutes or so. Fluff it with a fork and let it cool. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Whisk together the lemon juice, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, preserved lemon, baharat, and allspice. Stream in the olive oil while you whisk to finish the dressing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Finely chop all the parsley and toss it in a large bowl with the bulgur, almonds, and onion. Drizzle in the dressing and mix by hand. Serve right away. <br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Drawing, a Contemporary Approach: A Contemporary Approach</h2><p>Going beyond conventional approaches, this drawing text emphasizes the emotional, intellectual, and spiritual significance of art.

The authors are able to demystify the drawing process without sacrificing an understanding of its expressive power or of the complexity of artistic ideas it embodies. The inclusion of a diverse range of artists and artworks illustrates an equally diverse range of ideas that are made relevant to the act of drawing." -- Ruth Trotter, The University of La Verne<br><br>"The authors write beautifully on the philosophy of drawing and art and seem committed to educating readers on the changes that drawing has undergone in the last hundred years. They show us with a number of vivid illustrations and examples that drawing is a unique art form capable of bringing out the most creative impulses that an artist might be searching for&#x2026;""[They] have written a comprehensive exploration of the complexities of drawing today. They show us, through historical references with descriptive and inspirational illustrations, how drawing has progressed from its status as a preliminary layout tool to an art form in its own right&#x2026;.""DRAWING: A CONTEMPORARY APPROACH is an important text for anyone interested in drawing as it is currently being practiced. It allows us to see the possibilities within what the authors reveal as an exciting and dynamic medium." -- Craig Lloyd, College of Mt. Saint Joseph<br><br>"I found myself really inspired by the smart and fresh approaches to student projects. As a whole, I thought they functioned well as an intersection of new and old approaches to drawing, touching on obvious, time-tested approaches such as continuous contour of plants, but also opening up the idea of drawing to new techniques such as copy machine transfer&#x2026;""It is rare that a book can communicate effectively across the landscape of art, addressing the multivalent range of students' experience levels and interests.

To the east is T'ai-shan, Grand Mountain; to west is Hua-shan, Mountain of Flowers; to the south lies Heng-shan, the Mountain of Scales; to the north another Heng-shan, Eternal Mountain; and in the center stands Sung-shan, the Exalted Mountain. These are known as the Five Peaks, and the highest of them is Heng-shan, south of Tung-t'ing Lake, encircled by the river Hsiang on three sides. Upon Heng-shan itself there are seventy-two peaks that rise up and pierce the sky, some jagged and precipitous-blocking the paths of clouds-their fantastic shapes evoking wonder and awe, their auspicious shadows full of good fortune.<br>Among the seventy-two peaks, the five tallest are called Spirit of the South, Crimson Canopy, Heaven's Pillar, Stone Treasure-House, and Lotus Peak. They are regal, crowned by the heavens, and veiled in clouds, their bases obscured in mist. They are imbued with divine power, and in the haze of the day they are occluded from human view.<br>In ancient times, when Y&#x178; restrained the Great Flood that inundated the Earth, he erected a commemorative stone tablet on one of these peaks, recording his deed, and though many eons have passed, the inscription is still sharp and clear and one can still read the characters for "cloud" and "heaven" upon the stone.<br>In the days of Ch'in Shih-huang-ti, Lady Wei, having become a Taoist immortal, settled in these mountains with an attending company of fairies as decreed by Heaven. She was known as Lady Wei of the Southern Peak, and many are the strange and wonderful things she caused to happen there.<br>In the days of the T'ang dynasty a great monk arrived from India. He was so taken by the beauty of the mountains that he built a monastery on Lotus Peak, and there he taught The Diamond Sutra, instructed disciples, and banished evil spirits. In time people said that a living Buddha had descended to Earth. His name was Liu-kuan, and he explicated the sutras so clearly that they called him "Master of the Six Temptations," the Great Master Liu-kuan.<br>Among his five or six hundred disciples, there were some thirty who were advanced and well versed in these teachings, and the youngest of these was Hsing-chen. His features were fair and handsome, and a light shone from his face like flowing water. He had already mastered the scriptures, though he was barely twenty. He surpassed all the others in wisdom and mental agility, and all knew that the master loved him best and intended, in time, to make him his successor.<br>When Master Liu-kuan expounded upon the dharma to his disciples, the Dragon King himself-in the guise of a white-clad old man-would come from Tung-t'ing Lake to listen attentively. One day the master called his disciples together and said to them, "I am old now, and my health is failing. It has been more than ten years since I have been beyond the gates of these mountains. I must go and pay my respects to the Dragon King. Who among you will go in my stead to his Underwater Palace?"<br>Hsing-chen volunteered at once, and the master was greatly pleased. He had the young monk outfitted in new robes, presented him with a ringed staff, and sent him off toward Tung-t'ing Lake.<br>Just as Hsing-chen departed, the monk who guarded the monastery�s main gate came to Master Liu-kuan to announce that Lady Wei of the Southern Peak had sent eight of her fairies to see him and they were now waiting outside.<br>"Let them in," said Liu-kuan.<br>And they skipped in through the gate, one by one, circled him three times, and bowed, scattering fairy flowers at his feet. Kneeling respectfully, they recited a message from Lady Wei:<br>Venerable Master, you live on the west side of the mountain and I on the east. The distance is not far, and we are near enough to be neighbors. Yet I am so busy that I have not had occasion to visit your monastery to hear your teaching of the sutras. So now I am sending my servants to pay my respects and to offer you heavenly flowers, fairy fruit, silk brocade, and other humble gifts. I hope you will accept them as a token of my respect.<br>With that, each of the eight fairies presented flowers and other gifts to the master, and he received them and passed them on to his disciples, who, in turn, placed them as offerings before the Buddha in the shrine room.<br>Liu-kuan bowed ceremoniously, with hands folded. "An old man like me hardly deserves such lavish gifts as these you have presented to me," he said, and he gave generously to the fairies in return before they took their leave and set lightly off.<br>They made their way out through the mountain pass, hand in hand, chatting as they went. "In the past, we were free to go anywhere among these mountains," they said. "But now that the Great Master Liu-kuan has established his temple, some of the peaks are forbidden to us, and for nearly ten years we have missed seeing the places of beauty that were once ours to view. We are lucky that our lady's order brings us to this valley at a beautiful time of year.<br>"It is still early, so let us take this chance to climb up to the top of Lotus Peak. Let us loosen our garments, wash our scarves in the waterfall, and compose some poems. And when we return our sisters will envy us!"<br>They set off, walking hand in hand along the high precipices, gazing down at the cascading streams and the rushing waters. It was springtime, and myriad flowers filled the valleys below like a pink mist. The air was fresh and alive with an untold variety of birdsong.<br>The eight fairies sat to rest on a stone bridge, looking down at their reflections where the streams met in a wide pool as clear as crystal. Their dark brows and radiant faces were mirrored in the water like a classical painting done in a master's hand, and they were so captivated they did not notice the sun descending into the western mountains.</p><p>Hsing-chen crossed Tung-t'ing Lake and now entered the Underwater Palace. The Dragon King, hearing that Master Liu-kuan had sent one of his disciples, personally came to the gate with an entourage to greet him. When they had gone inside the palace, the Dragon King took his throne and Hsing-chen bowed and delivered his master�s message.<br>The Dragon King thanked Hsing-chen, and then held a great feast for him, full of fantastic delicacies he had never before tasted. But when the Dragon King offered him a cup of wine, Hsing-chen declined, saying, "Your Majesty, wine intoxicates the mind, and it is against my monastic vows to drink."<br>"Of course, I know that wine is among the five things that the Buddha forbade," the Dragon King replied. "But this wine is altogether different from the wine that mortals drink. It neither arouses passions nor dulls the senses. It instills calm and contentment. Surely you will not refuse it?"<br>Hsing-chen could not decline, and he had drunk three cups by the time he said his good-byes and left the Underwater Palace, riding on the wind to Lotus Peak. When he lighted there, he was already intoxicated and overcome by dizziness.<br>"Master Liu-kuan will be furious if he sees me this way," he said to himself. "He will scold me."<br>Crouching by the bank of a stream, he took off his robes and placed them on the clean sand. He dipped his hands in the clear water and was washing his hot face, when suddenly he noticed a strange and mysterious perfume wafting toward him. It was neither incense nor flowers, and it clouded his mind. "There must be flowers blooming upstream to put such wonderful fragrance in the air," he thought. "I must go find them."<br>He dressed carefully and followed the course of the stream upward; and there, quite suddenly, he found himself face-to-face with the eight fairies who were sitting on the stone bridge.<br>Hsing-chen dropped his staff and bowed deeply as he addressed them. "Ladies! I am a disciple of Master Liu-kuan and I live on Lotus Peak. I am on my way back from an errand for him. This bridge is not wide, and by sitting upon it, you are blocking my way. Would you kindly move aside and let me pass?"<br>The fairies returned his bow. "We are attendants to Lady Wei, and we are on our way back from delivering her greetings to your master. We have paused here to rest awhile. Is it not written in The Book of Rites, concerning the law of the road, that the man goes to the left and the woman to the right? Since this bridge is very narrow, and we are already sitting here, is it not proper for you to avoid it altogether and cross at some other place?"<br>"But the water is deep," Hsing-chen replied. "There is no other way to cross. Where do you suggest I go?"<br>"It is said that the great Bodhidharma crossed the ocean on a single leaf," said the fairies. "If you are, in fact, a disciple of Master Liu-kuan and you have studied the dharma with him, then surely you must have acquired some supernatural powers. It should not be hard for you to cross this tiny rivulet, so why do you stand there arguing with women over the right of way?"<br>Hsing-chen laughed. "I see from your attitude that you require some sort of payment for the right to cross, but I have no money. I am only a poor monk. Yet I do have eight jewels, which I will happily give to you if you will permit me to pass." With this he snapped off a branch from a peach tree and tossed it before the fairies. The fragrant peach blossoms that landed transformed into eight clear, sparkling, fragrant jewels.<br>The eight fairies laughed with delight. Each of them rose from her place and lifted a jewel, gave Hsing-chen a coy glance, mounted the wind, and flew away into the sky.<br>Hsing-chen stood at the bridge and watched for a long time looking in every direction, but he could not see where they had gone. Soon the multihued clouds had dissipated and even their fragrance was gone.<br>In a terrible state of dejection, Hsing-chen returned to the temple and delivered his message from the Dragon King. When Master Liu-kuan reprimanded him for his late return, Hsing-chen said, "The Dragon King detained me, Master, and it was not possible to refuse his generosity. That is why I have been delayed."<br>The master did not reply to this. He simply said, "Go away and rest."<br>Hsing-chen went back to his dim meditation cell and sat down alone. He could still hear the melodious voices of the eight fairies echoing in his ears, and his eyes still seemed to see their beautiful forms and faces as if they stood before him in the room. He found it impossible to control his racing thoughts-he could not meditate.<br>He thought to himself: "If a youth diligently studies the Confucian classics and serves his country as a minister of state or a general when he is grown into a man, he may dress in silks with an official seal upon his jade belt. He may look upon beautiful colors with the eyes and listen to beautiful voices with his ears. He may enjoy beautiful girls and leave an honorable legacy for his descendants. But a Buddhist monk has only a small bowl of rice and a cup of water. We read the sutras and meditate with our 108 mala beads hanging upon our necks. It is a lofty and profound endeavor, but it is terribly lonely. Though I may become enlightened, though I may master all the doctrines of the Mahayana path and sit in my master's seat to succeed him, once my spirit parts from my body in the flames of the funeral pyre, who will remember that a person named Hsing-chen ever lived upon this Earth?"<br>He tried to sleep, but sleep refused to come and the hour grew late. Whenever he closed his eyes, the eight fairies appeared before him, and when he opened them they vanished into nothingness. It suddenly occurred to him that the great purpose of Buddhism was to tame the mind and the heart. "I have been a monk for ten years," he said. "For ten years I have avoided the smallest fault, but these seductive thoughts will cause irreparable harm to my progress."<br>He burned incense, knelt, stilled his thoughts, and was counting his mala beads, visualizing the thousand Buddhas, when suddenly one of the temple boys came to his window and inquired, "Brother, are you asleep? The master is calling you."<br>Hsing-chen was alarmed. "It is unusual for him to call me in the middle of the night. It must be something serious," he thought.<br>He followed the boy to the main shrine hall, where all the monks of the temple had assembled. Master Liu-kuan himself was sitting in solemn silence in the light of many candles. His appearance inspired both fear and curiosity, and when he spoke it was with great care, with grave intonation.<br>"Hsing-chen! Do you know how you have sinned?"<br>Hsing-chen was kneeling before the dais. He bowed low, until his head touched the floor, and said, "Master, I have been your disciple for more than ten years now. I have never disobeyed you. I have tried to be pure. I am not hiding anything, and I do not know what offense I have committed."<br>Liu-kuan became angry. "You drank wine at the palace of the Dragon King! On your return, by the stone bridge, you flirted with eight fairy girls, joking with them, throwing them a branch of flowers, which you transformed into jewels. And since your return, you have turned away from the teachings of the Buddha and dwelt on worldly and sensual things. You have rejected your way of life here, and now you cannot stay!"<br>Hsing-chen wept, bent his head to the floor, and pleaded. "Master!" he said. "I know I have sinned. But I drank the wine only because the Dragon King himself offered it to me and I could not refuse. I bantered with the fairies at the bridge because I had to ask them to step out of the way. In my cell I faced temptation, but I came to my senses and controlled myself. If I have done wrong, you may whip me on the calves, but if you are so cruel as to send me away, how will I ever correct myself?<br>"I came to you to become a monk when I was only twelve, and so you are like a father to me. I serve you like a son. The relationship between master and disciple is deep and sacred. Where am I to go if I must leave Lotus Peak?"</p></p><h2>Pure Color: The Best of Pastel</h2><p>Pure Color is pure inspiration for all artists.

Judt focuses particularly on Blum's leadership of the Popular Front and his stern defiance of the Vichy governments, on Camus's part in the Resistance and Algerian War, and on Aron's cultural commentary and opposition to the facile acceptance by many French intellectuals of communism's utopian promise. Severely maligned by powerful critics and rivals, each of these exemplary figures stood fast in their principles and eventually won some measure of personal and public redemption.<br><br>Judt constructs a compelling portrait of modern French intellectual life and politics. He challenges the conventional account of the role of intellectuals precisely because they mattered in France, because they could shape public opinion and influence policy. In Blum, Camus, and Aron, Judt finds three very different men who did not simply play the role, but evinced a courage and a responsibility in public life that far outshone their contemporaries.<br><br>"An eloquent and instructive study of intellectual courage in the face of what the author persuasively describes as intellectual irresponsibility."&#x2014;Richard Bernstein, <i>New York Times</i></p><p>Intellectuals, virtually by definition, are expected to think for themselves. But the spectacle of intellectuals subordinating their independence of mind to dogmatic ideologies, whether left or right, is dismayingly common in the 20th century. The French call it <i>la trahison des clercs</i>. In <i>The Burden of Responsibility</i>, Tony Judt discusses three inspiring French intellectuals--Leon Blum, Albert Camus, and Raymond Aron--who courageously lived up to their political, moral, and intellectual responsibilities. Their courage, Judt notes, is all the more impressive since they were all outsiders: Blum and Aron were Jews, while Camus was reared and educated in Algeria, far from the training grounds of the French intelligentsia.<p> The longest, and arguably most exciting, chapter is devoted to Blum, whose efforts against extremists on the Left and the Right are truly remarkable. As the moral center of the Socialist Party, Blum was instrumental in keeping it independent of Moscow. When France fell in 1940, the Vichy government put him on trial, but he defended himself so adroitly that the German authorities, fearing embarrassment, ended the proceedings abruptly; subsequently, Blum survived two years in Buchenwald and Dachau, serving briefly as prime minister after the war. The chapter on Camus is, understandably, less dramatic, even despite his work in the Resistance; the chapter on Aron, best known for his work on the philosophy of history, is positively anticlimactic. Nevertheless, Judt's juxtaposition of these three intellectuals provides enlightenment not only about modern French history but also about the role of the responsible intellectual in society. <i>--Glenn Branch</i></p><b>Tony Judt</b> is the University Professor of European History at New York University and the author of several books, most recently, <i>Postwar: A History of </i><i>Europe</i><i> Since 1945</i>.</p><h2>In Search of Lost Time, Volume 6: Time Regained, A Guide to Proust</h2><p>1. Time is a central concern for Proust, appearing first in the title and last as the final word of the novel. What is his vision of the past? Does he have a vision of the present? The future? Can the Narrator be said to be living in the past? Is he like the White Queen in Through the Looking-Glass , with &#39;jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam today&#39;? 2. The renowned translator of Proust, C. K. Scott Moncrieff, originally grouped the opening section of In Search of Lost Time under the title &#39;The Overture,&#39; which includes two famous passages, the good night kiss and the evocative taste of the madeleine. Does this seem apt? If so, how might this fifty-odd page beginning prefigure what will transpire later? What would you expect to follow, given that an overture usually introduces the main themes of a musical work? What does it suggest about Proust&#39;s conception of literature and music? 3. The episode of the good night kiss strikes some readers as odd or contradictory: the Narrator&#39;s need for a kiss seems almost infantile, while his power of observation seems extraordinarily precocious. Considering that he is sent to bed at eight o&#39;clock, how old do you think the Narrator is? Is it significant that his father suggests the Narrator be given the kiss he craves, whereas his mother is reluctant, saying &#39;We mustn&#39;t let the child get into the habit . . .&#39;? Is the fact that the Narrator succeeds in getting the kiss he wants a good thing or a bad thing? Why? 4. &#39;The whole of Proust&#39;s world comes out of a teacup,&#39; observed Samuel Beckett. Indeed the episode of the madeleine dipped in tea is the first (and most famous) of numerous instances of &#39;involuntary memory&#39; in the novel. A recognized psychological phenomenon triggered by smells, tastes, or sounds, involuntary memory vividly reproduces emotions, sensations, or images from the past. Why do you think readers and critics universally consider this scene to be pivotal? What does the Narrator think about the experience of involuntary memory? What might its function be in the scheme of In Search of Lost Time ? 5. Another emblematic theme involves the recurring &#39;little phrase&#39; of music by Vinteuil that catches the ear of Swann at the Verdurin&#39;s salon and steals into his life. How do Vinteuil&#39;s compositions stir both Swann and the Narrator? In Proust&#39;s scheme of things, is music a higher art than painting or writing because it can produce involuntary memories? How does involuntary memory affect writing and painting? Is it unrelated to art except as a necessary catalyst? 6. In &#39;Combray&#39; we are introduced to the Narrator&#39;s family, their household, and their country home. Since Paris is the true heart of upper-class France, why do you think Proust chose to begin In Search of Lost Time elsewhere? What do we learn from the Narrator&#39;s description of his family&#39;s life and habits? Is the household dominated by men or by women? Does the Narrator&#39;s account seem accurate, or is it colored by his own ideas and preoccupations? 7. A madeleine dipped into a cup of tea first impelled Proust into the &#39;remembrance of things past.&#39; Though Proust was a gourmet in his youth, in the final years of his life he subsisted mainly on fillets of sole, chicken, fried potatoes, ice cream, cakes, fruit, and iced beer. Consider how food and culinary happenings - from meals at the restaurant in the Grand Hotel in Balbec to dinners at La Raspeli�re and the Guermantes&#39;s in Paris - form an integral part of the work. 8. Swann&#39;s Way and the Guermantes Way are presented as mutually exclusive choices for promenades, with Swann&#39;s Way given primacy of place at the novel&#39;s outset. Where, metaphorically speaking, does Swann&#39;s Way seem to lead? What are the aesthetic signposts and milestones the Narrator points out? What does the landscape around Combray represent? 9. &#39;I want my work to be a sort of cathedral in literature,&#39; Proust once said. In his description of the area around Combray - and in many other places in the novel - the Narrator describes churches, and particularly steeples. Indeed, Howard Moss cites the steeple as one of Proust&#39;s most important symbols. In religious architecture, the steeple represents man&#39;s aspiration toward God, and by inference toward Art, the Proustian religion. What else might it suggest? Does it have a counterpart in nature? 10. Proust and the Narrator share an appreciation of gardens and flowers - Proust himself was eager to visit Monet&#39;s celebrated garden - and in a sense, all Combray can be seen as a garden. What associations does this evoke? How does the Narrator respond to natural beauty? What do flowers mean to him? How do we know? 11. Proust&#39;s work is filled with &#39;doubling&#39; - the most obvious being the identification of the author with a fictional self of the same name but with somewhat different characteristics. Is Swann a double of the Narrator? What qualities do they share? In what ways do they seem different? What is the importance of the fact that Swann is a Jew? 12. Louis Auchincloss questions the use of a fictional first person named &#39;Marcel,&#39; who is but isn&#39;t Proust. Marcel claims that he is neither a snob nor a homosexual, yet he is obsessed with both. Would Proust have strengthened Marcel&#39;s viewpoint by making it that of the young social climber that he himself so clearly was? Did he enhance or detract from Marcel&#39;s credibility by casting him as one of the few heterosexuals in the book? Does it matter that Marcel regards &#39;inversion&#39; as a dangerous vice? Did Proust? 13. &#39;Swann in Love&#39; might be thought of as a dress rehearsal for the Narrator&#39;s own performance, and Swann&#39;s passion for Odette establishes a model for various other love relationships that appear later in the book. Proust believed that all emotions and behavior obey certain psychological laws. E. M. Forster maintained that &#39;Proust&#39;s general theory of human intercourse is that the fonder we are of people the less we understand them - the theory of the complete pessimist.&#39; Do you agree? How does Swann&#39;s love affair reflect this? What conclusions does the Narrator draw from his perception of Swann&#39;s experience? In what way does this differ from Swann&#39;s own view? 14. The Balbec sequence of Within a Budding Grove gathers a group of the novel&#39;s principal characters, many for the first time: Robert de Saint-Loup, the Baron de Charlus, and Albertine, to name three of the most important. Others begin to emerge in their true significance, like Elstir the painter. Why do you think Proust chose to bring them together in Balbec? In what ways does Balbec echo or amplify Combray? Is the little &#39;society&#39; of Balbec a preview in microcosm of Paris? 15. While writing In Search of Lost Time Proust often rummaged through his vast photographic collection of Belle �poque luminaries as a means of stimulating his memory. &#39;You could see that his thoughts were following a kind of underground track, as if he were organizing everything into images before putting them into words,&#39; recalled his maid C�leste Albaret. Indeed, the Baron de Charlus, in Within a Budding Grove , speaks of the special importance of photographs in preserving an unsullied moment of time past, before it has been altered by the present. Discuss how Proust used photographs in the story - just as he exploited the technology of trains, cars, and airplanes - as symbols of passing time. 16. In his landmark essay on Proust, Edmund Wilson praises the broad Dickensian humor and extravagant satire that animate vast sections of In Search of Lost Time , yet he goes on to call it &#39;one of the gloomiest books ever written.&#39; Can you reconcile Wilson&#39;s remarks? 17. Critic Barbara Bucknall maintains that &#39;no Proustian lover really cares at all for his beloved&#39;s feelings.&#39; Is this true? Would the Narrator agree? Would the</p><p>"Time Regained, the final volume of "In Search of Lost Time, begins in the bleak and uncertain years of World War I.

Although this approach is connected to the traditional study of languages, it differs enough in its specific conclusions about the structure and in its specific conclusions about the structure of language to warrant a name, "generative grammar." Various deficiencies have been discovered in the first attempts to formulate a theory of transformational generative grammar and in the descriptive analysis of particular languages that motivated these formulations. At the same time, it has become apparent that these formulations can be extended and deepened.The major purpose of this book is to review these developments and to propose a reformulation of the theory of transformational generative grammar that takes them into account. The emphasis in this study is syntax; semantic and phonological aspects of the language structure are discussed only insofar as they bear on syntactic theory.</p></p><p>Noam Chomsky is Institute Professor and Professor of Linguistics (Emeritus) at MIT and the author of many influential books on linguistics.<p>...

The authors describe shared elements in methods for selecting, estimating, checking, and interpreting each model, and show that these regression methods deal with confounding, mediation, and interaction of causal effects in essentially the same way.</p><p>This new book provides a unified, in-depth, readable introduction to the multipredictor regression methods most widely used in biostatistics: linear models for continuous outcomes, logistic models for binary outcomes, the Cox model for right-censored survival times, repeated-measures models for longitudinal and hierarchical outcomes, and generalized linear models for counts and other outcomes. Treating these topics together takes advantage of all they have in common. The authors point out the many-shared elements in the methods they present for selecting, estimating, checking, and interpreting each of these models. They also show that these regression methods deal with confounding, mediation, and interaction of causal effects in essentially the same way. The examples, analyzed using Stata, are drawn from the biomedical context but generalize to other areas of application. While a first course in statistics is assumed, a chapter reviewing basic statistical methods is included. Some advanced topics are covered but the presentation remains intuitive. A brief introduction to regression analysis of complex surveys and notes for further reading are provided. For many students and researchers learning to use these methods, this one book may be all they need to conduct and interpret multipredictor regression analyses. The authors are on the faculty in the Division of Biostatistics, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, and are authors or co-authors of more than 200 methodological as well as applied papers in the biological and biomedical sciences.

Please note the cover may sometimes be different to the one shown.</p><p><i>A Mathematician's Apology</i> is a profoundly sad book, the memoir of a man who has reached the end of his ambition, who can no longer effectively practice the art that has consumed him since he was a boy. But at the same time, it is a joyful celebration of the subject--and a stern lecture to those who would sully it by dilettantism or attempts to make it merely useful. "The mathematician's patterns," G.H. Hardy declares, "like the painter's or the poet's, must be <i>beautiful</i>; the ideas, like the colours or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics."<p> Hardy was, in his own words, "for a short time the fifth best pure mathematician in the world" and knew full well that "no mathematician should ever allow himself to forget that mathematics, more than any other art or science, is a young man's game." In a long biographical foreword to <i>Apology</i>, C.P. Snow (now best known for <i>The Two Cultures</i>) offers invaluable background and a context for his friend's occasionally brusque tone: "His life remained the life of a brilliant young man until he was old; so did his spirit: his games, his interests, kept the lightness of a young don's. And, like many men who keep a young man's interests into their sixties, his last years were the darker for it." Reading Snow's recollections of Hardy's Cambridge University years only makes <i>Apology</i> more poignant. Hardy was popular, a terrific conversationalist, and a notoriously good cricket player.</p><p> </p><blockquote> When summer came, it was taken for granted that we should meet at the cricket ground.... He used to walk round the cinderpath with a long, loping, clumping-footed stride (he was a slight spare man, physically active even in his late fifties, still playing real tennis), head down, hair, tie, sweaters, papers all flowing, a figure that caught everyone's eyes. "There goes a Greek poet, I'll be bound," once said some cheerful farmer as Hardy passed the score-board. </blockquote><p> G.H. Hardy's elegant 1940 memoir has provided generations of mathematicians with pithy quotes and examples for their office walls, and plenty of inspiration to either be great or find something else to do. He is a worthy mentor, a man who understood deeply and profoundly the rewards and losses of true devotion. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>G. H. Hardy was one of this century&#39;s finest mathematical thinkers, renowned among his contemporaries as a &#39;real mathematician ... the purest of the pure&#39;. This is a unique account of the fascination of mathematics and of one of its most compelling exponents in modern times.</p><h2>Human Rights and Social Justice in a Global Perspective: An Introduction To International Social Work</h2><p>Recognizing the growing importance of awareness of international social issues for social workers, this thoroughly revised edition provides an updated introduction to a variety of these issues in the Global South, including AIDS, forced labor and war and conflict. A new issue in this edition is examining how the changing physical environment impacts social work practice around the world. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other UN human rights documents, is used as a framework to examine examples of social injustice and human rights violations. The issues are examined in their cultural contexts to help the reader understand how they developed and why they persist. Each chapter for a particular issue ends in a "Culture Box" which offers an in-depth look at the issue in a particular country, enabling the reader to gain a deeper understanding of how culture impacts the development of social issues. Suggestions for effecting change, both in one's personal or professional life are listed for each chapter and an Appendix offers a variety of resources for engaging in international social work.<br></p><p><br>Susan C.

Morgenthau&#39;s Politics Among Nations: Politics Among Nations (The Macat Library)</h2><p><p>Hans Morgenthau&#x2019;s <em>Politics Among Nations</em> is a classic of political science, built on the firm foundation of Morgenthau&#x2019;s watertight reasoning skills.</p> <p>The central aim of reasoning is to construct a logical and persuasive argument that carefully organizes and supports its conclusions &#x2013; often around a central concept or scheme of argumentation. Morgenthau&#x2019;s subject was international relations &#x2013; the way in which the world&#x2019;s nations interact, and come into conflict or peace &#x2013; a topic which was of vital importance during the unstable wake of the Second World War. To the complex problem of understanding the ways in which the post-war nations were jostling for power, Morgenthau brought a comprehensive schema: the concept of &#x201c;realism&#x201d; &#x2013; or, in other words, the idea that every nation will act so as to maximise its own interests. From this basis, Morgenthau builds a systematic argument for a pragmatic approach to international relations in which nations seeking consensus should aim for a balance of power, grounding relations between states in understandings of how the interests of individual nations can be maximized.</p> <p>Though seismic shifts in international politics after the Cold War undeniably altered the landscape of international relations, Morgenthau&#x2019;s dispassionate reasoning about the nature of our world remains influential to this day.</p></p><p><strong>Dr. Ramon Pacheco Pardo</strong> is Senior Lecturer in International Relations at King&#x2019;s College London.

As Davies asks: 'Where is the Bauhaus for economic reform? Where is the futurist manifesto for a different form of money or property?' This collection captures something of the energy of those early 20th-century manifestos, offering windows onto new horizons that excite because they seem within our reach.</p>&#x2015;<b>Justin Reynolds</b>, <i>New Socialist</i></p><h2>A Foreign Policy for the Left</h2><p><b>Something that has been needed for decades: a leftist foreign policy with a clear moral basis</b><br><br> Foreign policy, for leftists, used to be relatively simple. They were for the breakdown of capitalism and its replacement with a centrally planned economy. They were for the workers against the moneyed interests and for colonized peoples against imperial (Western) powers. But these easy substitutes for thought are becoming increasingly difficult. Neo-liberal capitalism is triumphant, and the workers&#x2019; movement is in radical decline. National liberation movements have produced new oppressions. A reflexive anti-imperialist politics can turn leftists into apologists for morally abhorrent groups. In Michael Walzer&#x2019;s view, the left can no longer (in fact, could never) take automatic positions but must proceed from clearly articulated moral principles. In this book, adapted from essays published in <i>Dissent</i>, Walzer asks how leftists should think about the international scene&#x2014;about humanitarian intervention and world government, about global inequality and religious extremism&#x2014;in light of a coherent set of underlying political values.</p><p><b>Michael Walzer, </b>one of America&#x2019;s foremost political thinkers, served as editor of the political journal <i>Dissent</i> for more than three decades.

He reminds us that we can and must engage with our fellow citizens and global comrades, because we share their fate.&#x201d;&#x2014;Regina Munch, <i>The Progressive</i><br>&#x201c;Displays many of the virtues that have long distinguished Walzer as a leading thinker about war&#x2014;most notably his ability to frame clear ethical judgments that avoid the postures of both the saint and the cynic.&#x201d;&#x2014;Lawrence Douglas, <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i><br>"Walzer has chosen a just fight for his polemic, and he fights justly&#x2014;and to me his moral reasoning is clear and largely persuasive."&#x2014;Tod Lindberg, <i>Commentary</i><br>&#x201c;Walzer is among America&#x2019;s most thoughtful and influential left-wing public intellectuals.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael C. Desch, <i>Review of Politics</i><br>&#x201c;At a time when too many well-motivated leftists are trapped in what Michael Walzer characterizes as a complacent 'default position,' his case for leftist foreign-policy activism, buttressed by serious inquiry into a practical program of action, represents a significant accomplishment.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Goldfischer, Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver<br>"Michael Walzer addresses an urgent issue that has not received the attention it deserves&#x2014;the complex attitudes of American left-wing intellectuals toward American foreign policy in particular and American engagement with international affairs in general. &nbsp;He is unafraid to criticize the American left for parochialism, insularity, and even isolationism. This lucid, passionate book is bound to stimulate vigorous debate."&#x2014;Michael Ignatieff, President of Central European University, Budapest<br>"Michael Walzer may be America's most challenging philosopher of liberalism today. We are indeed fortunate that his essays are written with so much passion, eloquence, and precision that his readers may rest assured to find themselves in edifying, and often inspiring, company."&#x2014;Eric Alterman, columnist, <i>The Nation</i><br>"Michael Walzer&#x2019;s search for a sensible left-wing approach to international wrongs is one of the compelling ventures in our political-philosophical life, and it is beautifully on display in these cogent and challenging essays."&#x2014;Todd Gitlin, author of <i>The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage</i><br>"For those of us who grew up on <i>Just and Unjust Wars, </i>Michael Walzer is a beacon of honest, engaged debate.

He graduated from Harvard in 1837, the same year he began his lifelong Journal. Inspired by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau became a key member of the Transcendentalist movement that included Margaret Fuller and Bronson Alcott. The Transcendentalists' faith in nature was tested by Thoreau between 1845 and 1847 when he lived for twenty-six months in a homemade hut at Walden Pond. While living at Walden, Thoreau worked on the two books published during his lifetime: <b>Walden</b> (1854) and <b>A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers</b> (1849). Several of his other works, including <b>The Maine Woods, Cape Cod</b>, and <b>Excursions</b>, were published posthumously.

It typically has the reputation ofbeing aboring, complicated, and confusing mix of mathematical formulas and computers. Our goal in writing this casebook and the companion volume (Basic Business Statistics) was to change that impression by showing how statistics gives insights and answers interesting business questions. Rather than dwell on underlying formulas, we show how to use statistics to answer questions. Each case study begins with a business question and concludes with an answer. Formulas appear only as needed to address the questions, and we focus on the insights into the problem provided by the mathematics. The mathematics serves a purpose. The material is organized into 12 &#34;classes&#34; of related case studies that develop a single, key idea of statistics. The analysis of data using statistics is seldom very straightforward, and each analysis has many nuances. Part ofthe appeal ofstatistics is this richness, this blending of substantive theories and mathematics. For a newcomer, however, this blend is too rich and they are easily overwhelmed and unable to sort out the important ideas from nuances. Although later cases in these notes suggest this complexity, we do not begin that way. Each class has one main idea, something big like standard error. We begin a class by discussing an application chosen to motivate this key concept, and introduce the necessary terminology.</p><p></p><h2>Augustine of Hippo: A Biography</h2><p>This classic biography was first published forty-five years ago and has since established itself as the standard account of Saint Augustine's life and teaching.<br><br> The remarkable discovery of a considerable number of letters and sermons by Augustine cast fresh light on the first and last decades of his experience as a bishop. These circumstantial texts have led Peter Brown to reconsider some of his judgments on Augustine, both as the author of the <i>Confessions</i> and as the elderly bishop preaching and writing in the last years of Roman rule in north Africa. Brown's reflections on the significance of these exciting new documents are contained in two chapters of a substantial Epilogue to his biography (the text of which is unaltered). He also reviews the changes in scholarship about Augustine since the 1960s. A personal as well as a scholarly fascination infuse the book-length epilogue and notes that Brown has added to his acclaimed portrait of the bishop of Hippo.</p><p>"I salute Brown's achievement in bringing Augustine out of the tomb of theological doctrine, and setting his mind and emotions working before our eyes."&#x2014;Richard Southern, <i>New Statesman</i><br><br> "Justly applauded for its intelligence, and for the skill with which it relates the life and thought of a man dead for more than 1,500 years to the life we live now."&#x2014;Frank Kermode, <i>The Observer</i><br><br> "He has attained to the true stature of his subject."&#x2014;Owen Chadwick, <i>Catholic Herald</i><br><br> "It is an intellectual biography, a portrait in depth of the man, and a brilliant study of the period."&#x2014;J.

Carolyn Ellis, the leading proponent of these methods, does not disappoint. She weaves both methodological advice and her own personal stories into an intriguing narrative about a fictional graduate course she instructs. In it, you learn about her students and their projects and understand the wide array of topics and strategies that fall under the label autoethnography. Through Ellis&#39;s interactions with her students, you are given useful strategies for conducting a study, including the need for introspection, the struggles of the budding ethnographic writer, the practical problems in explaining results of this method to outsiders, and the moral and ethical issues that get raised in this intimate form of research. Anyone who has taken or taught a course on ethnography will recognize these issues and appreciate Ellis&#39;s humanistic, personal, and literary approach toward incorporating them into her work.

A human (according to some) who had lived about the time of Moses, but now indisputably a god, he was credited with the authorship of numerous books on magic and the supernatural, alchemy, astrology, theology, and philosophy. Until the early seventeenth century, few doubted the attribution. Even when unmasked, Hermes remained a byword for the arcane. Historians of ancient philosophy have puzzled much over the origins of his mystical teachings; but this is the first investigation of the Hermetic milieu by a social historian.</p><br><p> Starting from the complex fusions and tensions that molded Graeco-Egyptian culture, and in particular Hermetism, during the centuries after Alexander, Garth Fowden goes on to argue that the technical and philosophical Hermetica, apparently so different, might be seen as aspects of a single "way of Hermes." This assumption that philosophy and religion, even cult, bring one eventually to the same goal was typically late antique, and guaranteed the Hermetica a far-flung readership, even among Christians. The focus and conclusion of this study is an assault on the problem of the social milieu of Hermetism.</p></p><p><b>Garth Fowden</b> is a research fellow at the Center for Greek and Roman Antiquity of the National Hellenic Research Foundation in Athens, and the author of <i>Empire to Commonwealth: Consequences of Monotheism in Late Antiquity.</i>"[T]he books ascribed to Hermes . . . fall into two divisions, the technical and the philosophical, which Fowden treats separately. . . . [His] scholarly survery makes an excellent foundation for further study of points of detail and of paganism in general."

We are all economists - when we work, save for the future, invest, pay taxes, and buy our groceries. Yet many of us feel lost when the subject arises. Award-winning professor Timothy Taylor tackles all the key questions and hot topics of both microeconomics and macroeconomics, including: * Why do budget deficits matter? * What exactly does the Federal Reserve do? * Does globalization take jobs away from American workers? * Why is health insurance so costly? The perfect read for fans of Freakonomics, The Undercover Economist and Naked Economics, The Instant Economist offers the knowledge and sophistication to understand the issues - so you can understand and discuss economics on a personal, national, and global level.</p><p><b>Timothy Taylor</b> is managing editor of the American Economics Association's <i>Journal of Economic Perspectives</i>.

Taylor, the managing editor of the <i>Journal of Economic Perspectives</i>, also adds a good dose of humor.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Reference &amp; Research Book News</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Taylor sets out to teach us how economists think and begins with a microeconomics understanding of the economy (the view of individuals). We learn how markets work in the context of goods, labor, and financial capital and also about unregulated markets, including monopoly, the environment, and poverty; he notes that although these issues can attract democratic government involvement, such intervention can fail. He concludes with macroeconomics (an overall view of the economy), with topics including economic growth, unemployment, and inflation. Taylor wants us to respect the power of market forces but understand where those forces fall short; he encourages a belief that government policy can be useful but, in some cases, can be useless or even counterproductive...

Written and published by Equiano, a former slave, it became a prototype for the narratives that followed. Kidnapped in Africa as a child, Equiano was transported to the Caribbean and then to Virginia, bought by a Quaker shipowner, and placed in service at sea. Aboard various American and British ships, he sailed throughout the world, and he continued to do so after having purchased his freedom in 1766. Once settled in London, he fought tirelessly to end slavery. </p> <p>This edition of Equiano&#x2019;s <em>Narrative</em> places the text in the center of abolitionist activity in the late eighteenth century. Equiano knew many of the leading abolitionist figures of his time, and this edition allows readers to trace the common ideas and cross-influences in the works of the political and literary figures who fought for the end of slavery in America and England. The original 1789 text of the narrative has been used for the Broadview edition with Equiano&#x2019;s subsequent emendations included in the appendices. </p></p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literature.<p> <strong>Angelo Costanzo</strong>, Professor Emeritus of English, Shippensburg University, is one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on Equiano.

Breen explores how colonists who came from very different ethnic and religious backgrounds managed to overcome difference and create a common cause capable of galvanizing resistance. In a richly interdisciplinary narrative that weaves insights into a changing material culture with analysis of popular political protests, Breen shows how virtual strangers managed to communicate a sense of trust that effectively united men and women long before they had established a nation of their own.<br> <em>The Marketplace of Revolution</em> argues that the colonists' shared experience as consumers in a new imperial economy afforded them the cultural resources that they needed to develop a radical strategy of political protest--the consumer boycott. Never before had a mass political movement organized itself around disruption of the marketplace. As Breen demonstrates, often through anecdotes about obscure Americans, communal rituals of shared sacrifice provided an effective means to educate and energize a dispersed populace. The boycott movement--the signature of American resistance--invited colonists traditionally excluded from formal political processes to voice their opinions about liberty and rights within a revolutionary marketplace, an open, raucous public forum that defined itself around subscription lists passed door-to-door, voluntary associations, street protests, destruction of imported British goods, and incendiary newspaper exchanges. Within these exchanges was born a new form of politics in which ordinary man and women--precisely the people most often overlooked in traditional accounts of revolution--experienced an exhilarating surge of empowerment.<br> Breen recreates an "empire of goods" that transformed everyday life during the mid-eighteenth century. Imported manufactured items flooded into the homes of colonists from New Hampshire to Georgia. <em>The Marketplace of Revolution</em> explains how at a moment of political crisis Americans gave political meaning to the pursuit of happiness and learned how to make goods speak to power.</p><p><br><strong>T.H. Breen</strong> is William Smith Mason Professor of American History at Northwestern University. An authority on the culture and politics of the early Atlantic World, he has written six major books, including <em>Tobacco Culture</em> and <em>Imagining the Past</em>.<br><br>"With his new book T.H. Breen, who is one of the most imaginative and productive of early American historians, has carried scholarly interest in consumption in the eighteenth century to a new level.... By the time he is halfway or so through his book, Breen has succeeded admirably in proving the widespread availability of imported British consumer goods in the eighteenth-century colonies. This part of the book is a model of careful historical reconstruction. No one has ever demonstrated as fully and as exhaustively the nature and extent of American buying in the eighteenth century."--Gordon S. Wood, <em>The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"The most original interpretation of how the American Revolution happened to appear in print in the last fifty years."--Joseph J. Ellis, author of <em>Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation</em><p></p><br>"The author of this profoundly important book achieves what most historians only dream of. He propels forward to a new stage of understanding a subject--the origins of the American Revolution--that is large, complex and vexed by controversy."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"A powerfully argued book. Not only does it offer a detailed account of the workings of the eighteenth-century Atlantic economy--tracing the movement of an increasing variety of manufactured goods from Great Britain into the hands of an ever growing number of colonial consumers--but it also contains an imaginative interpretation of the origins of the American Revolution, transforming the Americans' extraordinary consumer power into political power."--Gordon S. Wood, author of <em>The Radicalism of the American Revolution</em><p></p><br>"Breen has demonstrated and documented, as never before, the popular origins of the American Revolution. In doing so he has given us new insights into the way a widely dispersed people forged a national identity. This is a seminal work that will affect all future understanding of our national beginnings." --Edmund S. Morgan, author of <em>Benjamin Franklin</em><p></p><br>"Breen draws a rich portrait of a Colonial society saturated with what Samuel Adams called 'the Baubles of Britain': everything from fine china to Cheshire cheese. The colonists were divided by religion and industry, but the shared a common identity as consumers of British products--and, increasingly, as wronged consumers, once Britain levied exorbitant tariffs and used America as a dumping ground for surplus goods. Tea, the Coca-Cola of its day, became a symbol of imperial overreach. Colonists reacted with what Breen sees as the Revolution's brilliant innovation: the consumer boycott. Benjamin Franklin told Parliament that, while the pride of Americans had been 'to indulge in the fashions and manufactures of Great Britain,' it was now 'to wear their old cloaths over again.' Because they shopped together, Americans could rebel together."--<em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Breen, an especially accomplished and insightful historian, offers an innovative explanation for the sudden and surprising creation of an American identity and union."--<em>The New Republic</em><p></p><br>"This interesting work offers an original perspective and some provocative conclusions."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"Both elegantly written and informed by the latest scholarship, this volume makes the outbreak of the American Revolution more comprehensible than anything currently on the shelves of your mega bookstore by focusing less on the theories of the founding fathers and more on the not-so-self-sufficient American colonists and the way their mass consumption led to their mass mobilization." --Carole Shammas, John R. Hubbard Chair in History, University of Southern California<p></p><br>"Given the depth of its scholarship, <em>The Marketplace of Revolution</em> is a surprisingly easy read...the well-worn story of the American Revolution gains an entirely unexpected urgency and suspense in his telling."--<em>New York Observer</em><p></p><br>"Breen makes a convincing case for the primacy of consumer interests in forging a unity among the colonies, and eventually creating the American union. Densely argued, with a wealth of examples."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Biology w/ARIS bind in card</h2><p><i>Biology</i> is a comprehensive introductory biology textbook for non-majors or mixed-majors courses that covers biology in a traditional order from the structure and function of the cell to the organization of the biosphere.

But by the early 1800s, China had fallen so far behind the West in gunpowder warfare that it was easily defeated by Britain in the Opium War of 1839&#x2013;42. What happened? In <i>The Gunpowder Age</i>, Tonio Andrade offers a compelling new answer, opening a fresh perspective on a key question of world history: why did the countries of western Europe surge to global importance starting in the 1500s while China slipped behind?</p><p>Historians have long argued that gunpowder weapons helped Europeans establish global hegemony. Yet the inhabitants of what is today China not only invented guns and bombs but also, as Andrade shows, continued to innovate in gunpowder technology through the early 1700s&#x2015;much longer than previously thought. Why, then, did China become so vulnerable? Andrade argues that one significant reason is that it was out of practice fighting wars, having enjoyed nearly a century of relative peace, since 1760. Indeed, he demonstrates that China&#x2015;like Europe&#x2015;was a powerful military innovator, particularly during times of great warfare, such as the violent century starting after the Opium War, when the Chinese once again quickly modernized their forces. Today, China is simply returning to its old position as one of the world's great military powers.</p><p>By showing that China&#x2019;s military dynamism was deeper, longer lasting, and more quickly recovered than previously understood, <i>The Gunpowder Age</i> challenges long-standing explanations of the so-called Great Divergence between the West and Asia.</p></p><p><p>"China invented gunpowder, guns, and bombs, so how did the West overtake, defeat, and humiliate the Chinese by the nineteenth century? Tackling one of history's biggest unsolved mysteries, <i>The Gunpowder Age</i> is indispensable to debates in world history--and as exciting, dramatic, and engaging as a novel."<b>--Jared Diamond, author of <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i></b></p><p>"This is a marvelous book and one of the most enjoyable works of military history, Chinese history, and East/West comparison that I have read in years. The reader learns many wonderful things, from the impressive history of early gunpowder weapons in China to China's ability to consistently defeat European expeditions in the 1600s. Andrade makes an original and vitally important contribution to debates about these fields and subjects."<b>--Jack Goldstone, author of <i>Why Europe? The Rise of the West in World History, 1500-1850</i></b></p><p>"At last we have a history of gunpowder that has been reconstructed as it should be, from both ends of the Eurasian continent. With the vigilance of the good historian and the zest of the good storyteller, Tonio Andrade argues brilliantly that the gunpowder age was as much the creation of China as of Europe. Let the controversy begin."<b>--Timothy Brook, author of <i>Mr. Selden's Map of China</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Gunpowder Age</i> is an important revisionist history that brings together a very impressive amount of new information and interpretation, and will be essential reading, much debated and built on by scholars of the early modern histories of both Europe and China."<b>--John E. Wills, Jr., author of <i>1688: A Global History, and The World from 1450 to 1700</i></b></p><p>"Tonio Andrade's engaging book overturns much received wisdom about gunpowder warfare and the West's 'Military Revolution.' Examining the development of gunpowder weapons in China and Europe, he shows that the Chinese consistently experimented with and adopted new weapons to suit their needs, but that their dynamic empire eventually fell victim to its own military successes. This is a must-read for anyone interested in the relationship between war, society, and state in Asia or Europe."<b>--Kenneth M. Swope, author of <i>The Military Collapse of China's Ming Dynasty, 1618&#x2013;44</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Gunpowder Age</i> is history that reads like a detective novel, telling a fascinating story that transforms our understanding of the impact of weapons technology."<b>--S.C.M.

Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946, Hermann Hesse commands a prominent place in the ranks of modern literatures masters.</p><p>Herman Hesse was born in southern Germany in 1877. Hesse concentrated on writing poetry as a young man, but his first successful book was a novel, Peter Camenzind (1904). During the war, Hesse was actively involved in relief efforts. Depression, criticism for his pacifist views, and a series of personal crises led Hesse to undergo psychoanalysis with J. B. Lang. Out of these years came Demian (1919), a novel whose main character is torn between the orderliness of bourgeois existence and the turbulent and enticing world of sensual experience. This dichotomy is prominent in Hesse&#39;s subsequent novels, including Siddhartha (1922), Steppenwolf (1927), and Narcissus and Goldmund (1930). Hesse worked on his magnum opus, The Glass Bead Game (1943), for twelve years. This novel was specifically cited when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946. Hesse died at his home in Switzerland in 1962.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Practical Electronics for Inventors 2/E</h2><p><p><b>THE BOOK THAT MAKES ELECTRONICS MAKE SENSE</b></p> This intuitive, applications-driven guide to electronics for hobbyists, engineers, and students doesn't overload readers with technical detail.

"Do I really <i>want</i> to be integrated into a burning house?" Baldwin demands, flicking aside the central race issue of his day and calling instead for full and shared acceptance of the fact that America is and always has been a multiracial society. Without this acceptance, he argues, the nation dooms itself to "sterility and decay" and to eventual destruction at the hands of the oppressed: "The Negroes of this country may never be able to rise to power, but they are very well placed indeed to precipitate chaos and ring down the curtain on the American dream."<p> Baldwin's seething insights and directives, so disturbing to the white liberals and black moderates of his day, have become the starting point for discussions of American race relations: that debasement and oppression of one people by another is "a recipe for murder"; that "color is not a human or a personal reality; it is a political reality"; that whites can only truly liberate themselves when they liberate blacks, indeed when they "become black" symbolically and spiritually; that blacks and whites "deeply need each other here" in order for America to realize its identity as a nation. </p><p> Yet despite its edgy tone and the strong undercurrent of violence, <i>The Fire Next Time</i> is ultimately a hopeful and healing essay. Baldwin ranges far in these hundred pages--from a memoir of his abortive teenage religious awakening in Harlem (an interesting commentary on his first novel <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>) to a disturbing encounter with Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad. But what binds it all together is the eloquence, intimacy, and controlled urgency of the voice. Baldwin clearly paid in sweat and shame for every word in this text. What's incredible is that he managed to keep his cool. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>&#34;So eloquent in its passion and so scorching in its candor that it is bound to unsettle any reader.&#34;--The Atlantic</p><h2>Complete Book of Spanish Workbook for Kids, Grades 1-3 Spanish Learning, Basic Spanish Vocabulary, Alphabet, Numbers, Colors, Parts of Speech, Expressions, Dates, and Songs With Spanish Learning Cards</h2><p><p><b>GRADES 1&#x2013;3/ESL/SPANISH:</b> With age-appropriate activities, this beginning Spanish workbook helps children build knowledge and skills for a solid foundation in Spanish.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>INCLUDES:</b> This book features easy-to-follow instructions for lessons on the alphabet, parts of speech, days, months, expressions, and more!

He is a distinguished soldier and she is beautiful and intelligent. However, what lies beneath the surface of their marriage is far more sinister and their influence leads John into a tragic drama that threatens to destroy everything he cares about.<br><br>Ford Madox Ford wrote <i>The Good Soldier</i>, the book on which his reputation most surely rests, in deliberate emulation of the nineteenth-century French novels he so admired. In this way he was able to explore the theme of sexual betrayal and its poisonous after-effects with a psychological intimacy as yet unknown in the English novel.</p><p>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed)</p></p><p>First published in 1915, Ford Madox Ford's <i>The Good Soldier</i> begins, famously and ominously, "This is the saddest story I have ever heard." The book then proceeds to confute this pronouncement at every turn, exposing a world less sad than pathetic, and more shot through with hypocrisy and deceit than its incredulous narrator, John Dowell, cares to imagine. Somewhat forgotten as a classic, <i>The Good Soldier</i> has been called everything from the consummate novelist's novel to one of the greatest English works of the century. And although its narrative hook--the philandering of an otherwise noble man--no longer shocks, its unerring cadences and doleful inevitabilities proclaim an enduring appeal.<p> Ford's novel revolves around two couples: Edward Ashburnham--the title's soldier--and his capable if off-putting wife, Leonora; and long-transplanted Americans John and Florence Dowell. The foursome's ostensible amiability, on display as they pass parts of a dozen pre-World War I summers together in Germany, conceals the fissures in each marriage. John is miserably mismatched with the garrulous, cuckolding Florence; and Edward, dashing and sentimental, can't refrain from falling in love with women whose charms exceed Leonora's. Predictably, Edward and Florence conduct their affair, an indiscretion only John seems not to notice. After the deaths of the two lovers, and after Leonora explains much of the truth to John, he recounts the events of their four lives with an extended inflection of outrage. From his retrospective perch, his recollections simmer with a bitter skepticism even as he expresses amazement at how much he overlooked.</p><p> Dowell's resigned narration is flawlessly conversational--haphazard, sprawling, lusting for sympathy. He exudes self-preservation even as he alternately condemns and lionizes Edward: "If I had had the courage and the virility and possibly also the physique of Edward Ashburnham I should, I fancy, have done much what he did." Stunningly, Edward's adultery comes to seem not merely excusable, but almost sublime. "Perhaps he could not bear to see a woman and not give her the comfort of his physical attractions," John surmises. Ford's novel deserves its reputation if for no other reason than the elegance with which it divulges hidden lives. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Ford Madox Ford wrote The Good Soldier, the book on which his reputation most surely rests, in deliberate emulation of the nineteenth-century French novels he so admired. In this way he was able to explore the theme of sexual betrayal and its poisonous after-effects with a psychological intimacy as yet unknown in the English novel.</p><h2>Nicomachean Ethics (Dover Thrift Editions: Philosophy)</h2><p>Hailed by Dante as "the master of those who know," the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384&#x2013;322 B.C.) surveyed every field of learning known to the ancient world and pioneered the sciences of psychology and logic. A disciple of Plato and the tutor to Alexander the Great, Aristotle was a prolific writer, although many of his works have been lost. His treatises, used by the students of his famous Athenian school, the Lyceum, exerted a profound and lasting influence on Western thought.<br>Aristotle's <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> is one of the world's great books. Identifying happiness as the goal of life, he rejects pleasure, fame, and wealth as means to it.

He attended Mt. St. Mary&#x2019;s College in Sheffield, England, then completed a degree in civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Lofting fought in World War I, in the Irish Guards and was seriously wounded, ending up in Connecticut. While he was away in the war. instead of writing about the horrific scenes he was witnessing, he would write fanciful stories back home to his children. Those letters would eventually form the basis for more than a dozen &#x201c;Doctor Dolittle&#x201d; stories, which were written between 1920 and 1952. The second book in the series, &#x201c;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle,&#x201d; won the second-ever Newbery Award. Hugh was married to Flora Small in 1912 and settled in New York and had two children, but she died in 1927. He married Katherine Harrower in 1928, but she died the same year. He was married a third time in 1935 to Josephine Fricker with whom he had a son. After that, the family moved to California. Lofting died on September 26, 1947, in Topanga, California at the age of 61. He is buried in Killingsworth, Connecticut.</p><h2>Grow Your Own Herbal Remedies: How to Create a Customized Herb Garden to Support Your Health &amp; Well-Being</h2><p>Expert herbalist Maria No�l Groves has advice for budding herb gardeners: grow just what your body needs!<br><br> In <i>Grow Your Own Herbal Remedies</i><b><i>, </i></b>Groves provides 23&nbsp;garden plans specially tailored to address the most common health needs, along with simple recipes for using each group of herbs.

They made it appear that way in order to divert attention from the alliance between the Fourth Reich and the race of aliens known as the Reptilians--an ancient galactic civilization obsessed with conquest and domination. After the German surrender in 1945, the Nazi-Reptilian alliance infiltrated the U.S. military-industrial complex. Through &#x201c;Operation Paperclip,&#x201d; the Nazis and Reptilians removed their political opponents, such as the Kennedys, and moved into policy-making positions in post-war America, infiltrating aerospace companies, banking, media, and the U.S. government, including NASA and the CIA. But their real target was not the United States--it was the solar system. <br><br>As Len Kasten reveals in startling detail--including revelations of antigravity propulsion technology, alien techniques of mass mind control, and hyperdimensional teleportation capabilities--the Nazi-Reptilian alliance used their newfound power, wealth, and influence to launch a Secret Space Program with interstellar spaceports in Antarctica and on Mars as well as an eleven-story base of operations on the Moon. They commenced mining and manufacturing operations on Mars and Ceres, forming colonies there and elsewhere in the solar system. And, most shocking, they have used thousands of human slaves, easily transported in their spaceships, for both work and sexual exploitation. <br><br>Sharing testimonies from American and British &#x201c;supersoldiers&#x201d; who participated in the &#x201c;20 and Back&#x201d; age-regression programs, Kasten reveals the various forces inside and outside government that are resisting the Nazis and thwarting Reptilian attempts to achieve total dominance of the planet and the solar system. The U.S.-led Secret Space Program has its own fleet of spaceships, the Solar Warden Space Armada, which patrols the edges of the solar system and poses a growing threat to the Nazi Dark Fleet.</p><p>Len Kasten is a UFO researcher and freelance writer. He intensively studied the Edgar Cayce Readings at the A.R.E. in Virginia Beach and has been a lifelong devotee of astrology and theosophy. He is a former member of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), and he is the president of the American Philosopher Society. He has been a feature writer, with more than 50 published articles, for <i>Atlantis Rising</i> magazine. He lives in Casa Grande, Arizona.<i>Chapter 8. Nazis on the Moon and Mars <br><b>Neu Berlin: A City under Ice</b></i> <br><br>By mid-1943, as the tide of war changed, the Allies noticed increased submarine traffic in the South Atlantic. At that point, the Neuschwabenland development project in Antarctica was taken out of the control of Hermann G�ring and turned over to Heinrich Himmler. Therefore, it now became an S.S. operation. G�ring&#x2019;s reputation had plummeted after he lost the Battle of Britain, and the British fighters and bombers were now wreaking major damage. Also the British army was back in the fight after the miraculous rescue at Dunkirk. So the renewed attention to Neuschwabenland probably reflected the new wartime reality. Himmler now focused on making Neuschwabenland a racially pure Aryan colony. He selected ten thousand young Ukranian women, all blonde and blue-eyed, and 2,500 battle-hardened Waffen S.S.soldiers to breed the new race to become the foundation of the Fourth Reich under the ice in the now burgeoning city of Neu Berlin. <br><br>The build-up of Neuschwabenland was massive. After the war, the Allies were able to determine that fifty-four U-Boats were missing from the German fleet. Also, they estimated that between 142,000 and 250,000 people were unaccounted for, including the so-called &#x201c;Lost Battalion&#x201d; and the entire S.S. Technical Branch, which was under the direction of Himmler. This was the group responsible for the development and manufacture of the antigravity discs. Also missing were 6,000 scientists and technicians and tens of thousands of slave laborers. Clearly, they all ended up in Antarctica. This explains how the Nazis were able to defeat Admiral Byrd&#x2019;s armada in Operation Highjump in 1946. It has been estimated that the current population of Neu Berlin is two million. <br><br><b><i>Himmler&#x2019;s Antarctic Space Port</i></b> <br><br>Heinrich Himmler was a rabid believer in occultism, and in his sinister SS castle in Wewelsburg he conducted s�ances to contact the demons in the astral realm, who we now know were really Reptilians. So it was probably through Himmler that contact and coordination with the Reptilians continued. Since we know that the Reptilians had an ancient colony in Antarctica, it is reasonable to conclude that they convinced Himmler to become involved in the Neuschwabenland project after G�ering&#x2019;s status declined. But more importantly, Himmler was made to understand that winning the war was no longer the long-term Nazi objective. It was the post-war that mattered, and the future of the Nazi party was no longer confined to Earth. It was now in the solar system, and beyond. It is not clear how the Reptilians were able to expand Himmler&#x2019;s horizons, but we do know that he eagerly adopted his new role as galactic leader of the Nazi party and the coordinator of the transformation of Antarctica into a space port. <br><br>Apparently, the Reptilians liked the idea of a ruthless, amoral human contingent doing all their earthly dirty work for them, especially humans who enjoyed enslaving and abusing large 4 masses and using them for genetic experimentation. As we have learned in previous chapters, the Nazis fulfilled that role perfectly. Also, they acted as cold-blooded intermediaries in obtaining human flesh and blood for the cannibalistic Reptilians. It was a marriage made in Hell. And so, this cosmic partnership was forged, and these soulless humans got to continue their jack-booted Nazi authority off the earth, as long as their Reptilian overlords found them useful.<br><br> <b><i>Operation Tabarin</i></b> <br><br>In late 1945, after the conclusion of the war, in what became known as Operation Tabarin, British Commandos from the secret Maudheim Base in Antarctica discovered the entrance to the tunnel leading to the Nazi base under the Antarctic ice shelf in Queen Maud Land. According to an article in the August 2005 issue of <i>Nexus Magazine</i>, by British historian James Roberts, the soldiers followed the tunnel for miles and eventually came to a &#x201c;vast underground cavern that was abnormally warm; some of the scientists believed that it was warmed geothermally. In the huge cavern were underground lakes; however, the mystery deepened as the cavern was lit artificially. . . . The Nazis had constructed a huge base into the caverns and had even built docks for U-boats, and one was identified supposedly. Still, the deeper they traveled, the more strange visions they were greeted with. They ultimately discovered &#x201c;hangars for strange planes and excavations galore.&#x201d; Only one Commando survived that operation. He told his story to a new team, which became Operation Tabarin II, in October 1945. They were more successful, blowing up the entrance to the tunnel. One surviving team member from that heroic group said, &#x201c;As we looked over the entire cavern network, we were overwhelmed by the number of personnel scurrying about like ants, but what was impressive were the huge constructions that were being built. From what we were witnessing, the Nazis, it appeared, had been on Antarctica a long time.&#x201d;</p><h2>Physical Geography: Science and Systems of the Human Environment</h2><p>A comprehensive&nbsp;fully integrated, systems-based approach to physical geography, Strahler's highly successful text is considered the standard for an undergraduate two-semester course in physical geography.

Whether or not you were raised in an addictive family system, It Will Never Happen To Me may very well offer a framework to understand your situation. We have long recognized that people raised with physical and sexual aabuse strongly identify as if they were raised with addiction. People raised with mental illness, ranging from schizophrenia to depression, to raging parents, frequently identify with adult child issues. People raised with parents afected by chronic health issues, physical challenges, as well as those raised by an adult child (an adult child who may not manifest an addiction, but the thinking and behavior is often characteristic of an addict) may also identify. The connecting thread between these different types of families is experienc! ing chronic loss that fuels emotional isolation, rigidity, or shame. <p>Whatever the circumstances, when you come from a history of loss, it is like being a first cousin to the person raised with addiction. Therefore, if this information can benefit others raised in troubled families, this is an added gift.</p>Claudia A.

From &#34;pompons&#34; to &#34;waterlilies&#34; few flowers can boast such a variety of choices for every garden and gardener. In this delightful and profusely illustrated encyclopedia, noted hybridizer and nurseryman Bill McClaren provides an authoritative account of garden-worthy dahlias for every garden design. Nearly 700 selections are included, complete with notes on their history, awards, and cultural peculiarities. Additional chapters on dahlia care and propagation, dahlia species in nature, hybridizing, and showing dahlias add to this well-rounded overview. Thorough appendices with resources on dahlia societies, nurseries, and gardens complete the book. Gardeners at every level will appreciate the author&#39;s clear and useful explanation of the classification schemes for dahlias, which can often intimidate even determined enthusiasts. Every dahlia lover will gain years of reference and enjoyment from Bill McClaren&#39;s definitive encyclopedia.</p><p>Bill McClaren has been growing and showing dahlias for nearly 50 years. For the past 20 years, he has hybridized all forms of dahlias; over 100 of his varieties are listed in the <i>American Dahlia Society's ADS Classification and Handbook of Dahlias</i>. After retiring from a 30-year career as an educator, he owned and operated, together with his wife, Alpen Gardens, a commercial dahlia nursery, for 20 years. He is a member of the American Dahlia Society. He is a Senior Judge and instructs dahlia judging schools throughout the northwestern United States and Canada. His articles have been published in the <i>Bulletin of the American Dahlia Society</i> and <i>Dahlias of Today</i>.A major factor in growing dahlias successfully is the treatment of the tubers. Tubers that are grown, dug, and stored properly will produce healthy, vigorous plants when replanted.<br><br> After the dahlia plant has completed its full growth cycle, it goes dormant. In warm climates the dormancy period can be as short as a few months, and tubers may be left in the ground. In areas where the ground freezes the tubers need to be dug and stored. Dahlia growers often find it difficult to keep tubers viable during long storage. Understanding the correct methods of caring for tubers can simplify the task.<br><br> Dahlias will tolerate a wide range of soil types and pH levels; however, the healthiest tubers are produced when the plants are grown in a nutrient-rich and organically healthy soil. Compost, organic fertilizer, and humus should be added yearly to maintain soil viability and optimize tuber health and production.<br><br> In warm, frost-free climates, tubers may be planted at any time of the year. In climates where it freezes, plant tubers after the danger of frost has passed. Place tubers in the ground 1 to 3 ft. (0.3 to 0.9 m) apart, depending on the size of the plant. The space around each plant needs to be adequate for good air circulation; air movement will keep the plant leaves dry, which helps to discourage airborne plant diseases.<br><br> Your garden soil type determines the depth to plant the tubers. The depth of the tuber will depend on the soil structure and temperatures. Sandy soil and high temperatures may require depths of 3 to 4 in. (7.5 to 10 cm); heavy soils with low temperatures, depths of 2 to 3 in. (5 to 7.5 cm). Soil temperature needs to be 50 to 80�F (10 to 27�C) in order for the tuber to break its dormancy and begin growing. If the soil temperature is too cold and wet, tubers can disintegrate. If the soil temperature is too warm, the tubers break down and will not grow. Mark your plantings with tags or stakes so they can be easily identified at digging time.<br><br> Dahlias can be propagated from cuttings. The tubers produced from a cutting will keep well in storage, often better than tubers produced by a plant. The number and form of tubers produced from cuttings depends on the method of planting the cuttings. When planted upright, they will seldom produce more than two misshapen tubers with viable eyes. To increase tuber production and improve the form, let the cutting grow to 8 to 10 in. (20 to 25 cm). Lay the plant horizontally in a 3 in. (7.5 cm) trench, and then cover the roots and cutting to the top set of leaves. As the plant grows it will develop three to five perfectly shaped tubers at each node.<br><br> A dahlia plant needs a minimum of three months' growth to develop mature tubers. The feeder root system is shallow on the dahlia plant; deep cultivation can cause root damage and should be avoided. During the growing season, a thorough weed-control program is essential. Dahlias also need consistent watering and fertilizing for healthy tuber production. During the bloom season all spent blooms should be removed, which will increase nutrients to the tuber. Several weeks before digging the tubers, discontinue watering and fertilizing so the tuber growth will slow and tubers will begin hardening-off in preparation for harvest.<br><br> Dahlia tubers will be destroyed if they are allowed to freeze so in certain areas they will need to be dug each year. In the short days of fall, the plant's flowers will lose their form and have open centers. The plant will develop weak stems and start setting seed. This is an indication the plants are going into dormancy. The tubers can be dug at any time. After frost the eyes will develop on the tubers and make the tubers easier to divide.<br><br> If there is a chance the ground will freeze, leave the frosted tops on the plants until they are dug to help protect the soil and tubers from freezing. Before digging the tubers, remove all ties and stakes. Check the labels on the tags for correct identification. Cut the top growth from the plant leaving 4 to 6 in. (10 to 15 cm) of stem attached to the base of the plant. This short piece of stalk will give you a convenient place to attach identification tags and it will provide a means for handling the dahlia clump. Use a shovel or digging fork to carefully loosen the soil around the tuber clump and then gently lift it from the ground. Always handle dahlia clumps carefully to avoid breaking the fragile necks on the tubers. Finally, wash all soil from the clump, using a forceful spray of water. The force of the spray should be sufficient to remove all the soil from the clump of tubers; however, it should not be so forceful that the thin protective "skin" that covers the outside of the tubers is damaged.<br><br> It is important to divide the tuber clumps and get them in storage as soon as possible. In very dry climates, where the humidity is less than 50%, the tubers should be kept moist while you work to divide them. If the humidity is high, the tubers can be allowed to air dry in the shade. Some growers successfully dig and store the tuber clumps without dividing. Many growers dig only what they can divide and store in the same day. Both methods have advantages. If the clumps are not divided until spring, it is easier to see the new growth, which greatly aids in division. Undivided clumps require considerably more storage space than clumps that have been divided.<br><br> Dahlia clumps can be divided and separated into individual tubers with knives, long-nosed clippers, saws, or any tool that will remove the tuber from the clump. Tools used for dividing the tuber clump must be sharp in order to make a clean cut. To help prevent injury, wear rubber or latex gloves and work under adequate light. The long-nosed clipper is an especially safe tool.<br><br> Before dividing the tubers, remove any damaged tubers, all root hairs, and any tubers smaller than a pencil in diameter. Leave only the trimmed tubers on the clump. When you divide the clump each tuber must have a viable eye. The eyes are located near the stem of the clump. It is necessary to have an eye on each tuber for new growth to develop the following year. For the first cut, divide the clump into two parts. It is now possible to separate each tuber from the divisions, each with a viable eye. Remove as much of the stem as possible from each tuber. It may be necessary to leave two or three tubers attached in order to keep an intact eye.<br><br> As soon as the tubers are divided, identify each one somehow (by name, numerically) with a permanent indelible marker. When marking many tubers of one variety, a rubber stamp kit will speed up the process. Some growers dip their tubers in fungicide or a weak bleach solution before storage; however, no research proves the benefit of such a dipping.</p><h2>Functions, Statistics, and Trigonometry (UCSMP - University of Chicago School Mathematics Project)</h2><p>Rated &#34;Top 10&#34; by the U.S. Department of Education, UCSMP is the first full mathematics curriculum to implement the NCTM Standards by emphasizing applications, reading and writing, problem solving, and technology.

In his nuanced analysis of prominent German artists, architects, composers, film directors, painters, and writers who rejected exile, choosing instead to stay during Germany&#x2019;s darkest period, Petropoulos shows how individuals variously dealt with the regime&#x2019;s public opposition to modern art. His findings explode the myth that all modern artists were anti-Nazi and all Nazis anti-modernist.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Artists Under Hitler</i> closely examines cases of artists who failed in their attempts to find accommodation with the Nazi regime (Walter Gropius, Paul Hindemith, Gottfried Benn, Ernst Barlach, Emil Nolde) as well as others whose desire for official acceptance was realized (Richard Strauss, Gustaf Gr�ndgens, Leni Riefenstahl, Arno Breker, Albert Speer).

Parallax can be defined as the apparent displacement of an object, caused by a change in observational position. Zizek is interested in the "parallax gap" separating two points between which no synthesis or mediation is possible, linked by an "impossible short circuit" of levels that can never meet. From this consideration of parallax, Zizek begins a rehabilitation of dialectical materialism.Modes of parallax can be seen in different domains of today's theory, from the wave-particle duality in quantum physics to the parallax of the unconscious in Freudian psychoanalysis between interpretations of the formation of the unconscious and theories of drives. In The Parallax View, Zizek, with his usual astonishing erudition, focuses on three main modes of parallax: the ontological difference, the ultimate parallax that conditions our very access to reality; the scientific parallax, the irreducible gap between the phenomenal experience of reality and its scientific explanation, which reaches its apogee in today's brain sciences (according to which "nobody is home" in the skull, just stacks of brain meat--a condition Zizek calls "the unbearable lightness of being no one"); and the political parallax, the social antagonism that allows for no common ground. Between his discussions of these three modes, Zizek offers interludes that deal with more specific topics--including an ethical act in a novel by Henry James and anti-anti-Semitism.The Parallax View not only expands Zizek's Lacanian-Hegelian approach to new domains (notably cognitive brain sciences) but also provides the systematic exposition of the conceptual framework that underlies his entire work. Philosophical and theological analysis, detailed readings of literature, cinema, and music coexist with lively anecdotes and obscene jokes.</p></p><p>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek is a philosopher and cultural critic.

The Guardian</p><br><br><p>"A remarkable demonstration of continental philosophical and psychoanalytical pyrotechnics. More provocative ideas per page than normally found in whole books by the dull anglophone empiricists who find him so threatening." Paul A. Taylor Times Higher Education</p><br><br><p>"Frankly, a magnum opus is exactly what &#x17d;i&#x17e;ekneeds right now.... <i>The Parallax View</i> consolidates &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek's work as a whole and decisively moves it forward."

When purchased as a 2-volume set, one copy of the student workbook is included with a teacher&#39;s manual.</p><p><i>Jump In</i> is a two-year writing program for middle school students (grades 6-8), although it might also be used with high schoolers who need more work on basic writing skills or need a user-friendly approach to motivate them to improve their skills. Written particularly for Christian homeschoolers, it is designed for students to work independently most of the time, and it assumes a Christian audience, with references to favorite Bible verses, church activities, judgments about Greek gods and goddesses, spiritual motivations of characters in stories, and similar Christian experiences and attitudes. <p> The course consists of a student book plus a teacher guide titled <i>The Lifeguard's Locker: A Parent/Teacher Manual</i> for <i>Jump In</i>. Both are essential. The 248-page student work text includes instruction, activities, and assignments plus helpful reference tools at the back. Assignments are presented in seven sections of varying length: pre-writing skills, opinion, persuasion, exposition, description, narration, and poetry. Within each section, lessons are presented as a series of skills so that students approach each type of writing in bite-size chunks. For most of the activities student will write directly in their workbook, spending from five to twenty minutes per lesson on writing activities. I particularly like the way Sharon Watson has interspersed activities throughout the instruction to ensure that students are processing and applying as they learn. At the end of each section of skill lessons, students are given a number of writing assignments from which to choose. These lengthier assignments might take anywhere from two to ten days to complete and will likely be done either in a notebook or on the computer. </p><p> The teacher manual has answers for the activities when they are predictable answers, and it also has an extensive section on evaluating lengthier student work with reproducible forms and samples of completed forms -- very helpful for the inexperience parent/teacher. </p><p> The student workbook itself might be completed in one school year. What transforms <i>Jump In</i> into a two-year program are the '10-Minute Writing Plunges' found in the teacher manual. These are a number of writing prompts -- four per week for September through May -- that are the basis for ten-minute writing assignments to be completed Monday through Thursday. You are free to substitute your own writing prompts if you wish. On Friday, students select their favorite of the four papers and polish it to be turned in on the following Monday. </p><p> The Writing Plunges are not to be used at the same time as students are working through their other lessons. They might be used on their own as the second year of the program or you might break up the workbook lessons by spending a month or more on Writing Plunges between sections of the book. </p><p> A fairly comprehensive course, <i>Jump In</i> provides instruction from brainstorming, topic selection, and construction of a composition with an introduction, body, and conclusion all the way through the use of citations (either included within the text of the composition or at the end of the quoted or referenced material) and creation of a bibliography. Note that the 'exposition' section of the workbook expands to include lessons on writing biographies, book reports, book responses, newspaper articles, how-to articles, and compare and contrast essays. </p><p> The student workbook is very attractive. Printed in full color, it includes illustrations and graphics that break up the print content and keep students from getting overwhelmed. Students will also need a grammar reference book or they might need additional grammar instruction if they are weak in this area; suggestions are included in the teacher manual. </p><p> I expect this [course] will be a popular choice for homeschoolers. --Cathy Duffy, cathyduffyreviews.com</p></p><h2>Strategic Management: A Competitive Advantage Approach, Concepts (16th Edition)</h2><p>Strategic Management: A Competitive Advantage Approach, Concepts (16th Edition) 16/E by Fred R.

Theatre is presented as a global and multicultural form that reflects both traditional and evolving world views. While the American commercial theatre and European forms are central to the text, alternative theatres are placed side by side for comparison and contrast in each chapter, thus avoiding the sense of &#x201c;otherness&#x201d; created by devoting separate chapters to diversity and departures from the western tradition. </p></p><p><i>The World of Theatre: Tradition and Innovation</i> is the first introduction to theatre text to fully focus on diversity and globalism, integrating coverage of multicultural, international, and experimental theatre throughout.

It reflects the changing and increasingly diverse student population as no other text does. <p> <b> Exciting Features </b> </p><ul> <li> <b>Integrated global and diversity coverage</b> places multicultural, international, and alternative theatres side-by-side with more familiar material, emphasizing the importance and influence of these traditions and trends rather than marginalizing them. </li><li> <b>History coverage</b> is interwoven throughout the text and appears in context, where relevant, rather than being isolated in one or two separate chapters. </li><li> <b>A rich boxed-feature program</b> gives students ways of thinking about particular issues in the theatre, which in turn helps them to understand how theatre works and why it has the impact that it does. </li><li>A unique chapter, <b> Technology and Theatrical Innovation, </b> examines how theatre has always made use of available technology to heighten its expressive power.

Placing theatre in a broader context, expanding the definition of theatre beyond a narrow western focus, is long overdue. The breadth of the book and wealth of examples from all over the world are astonishing. <br> <i>Susan Mason, California State University&#x2014;Los Angeles</i> </p><p> This is a highly readable and engaging book. The individual chapter contents nicely cross-reference with each other, and the book never &#x2018;bogs down&#x2019; in history. The very breadth of the subject matter remains outstanding, articulate, and engaging. <br> <i>Richard Hansen, Middle Tennessee State University</i> </p><p> The author&#x2019;s approach is innovative and applaudable, and a welcome addition to the more traditional textbooks in this field that focus primarily on Western theatrical forms with a separate chapter or two on non-Western forms. <br> <i>Nina LeNoir, Minnesota State University&#x2014;Mankato</i> </p><p> The textbook is worthwhile, and becomes more apparent as the chapters evolve.

Slot machines, revamped by ever more compelling digital and video technology, have unseated traditional casino games as the gambling industry's revenue mainstay. <i>Addiction by Design</i> takes readers into the intriguing world of machine gambling, an increasingly popular and absorbing form of play that blurs the line between human and machine, compulsion and control, risk and reward.</p><p>Drawing on fifteen years of field research in Las Vegas, anthropologist Natasha Dow Sch�ll shows how the mechanical rhythm of electronic gambling pulls players into a trancelike state they call the "machine zone," in which daily worries, social demands, and even bodily awareness fade away. Once in the zone, gambling addicts play not to win but simply to keep playing, for as long as possible--even at the cost of physical and economic exhaustion. In continuous machine play, gamblers seek to lose themselves while the gambling industry seeks profit. Sch�ll describes the strategic calculations behind game algorithms and machine ergonomics, casino architecture and "ambience management," player tracking and cash access systems--all designed to meet the market's desire for maximum "time on device." Her account moves from casino floors into gamblers' everyday lives, from gambling industry conventions and Gamblers Anonymous meetings to regulatory debates over whether addiction to gambling machines stems from the consumer, the product, or the interplay between the two.</p><p><i>Addiction by Design</i> is a compelling inquiry into the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance, offering clues to some of the broader anxieties and predicaments of contemporary life. At stake in Sch�ll's account of the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance is a blurring of the line between design and experience, profit and loss, control and compulsion.</p></p><p><p>"A stunning portrayal of technology and the inner life. Searing, sobering, compelling: this is important, first-rate, accessible scholarship that should galvanize public conversation."--<b>Sherry Turkle, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, author of <i>Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other</i></b></p><p>"A fascinating, frightening window into the world of gambling in Las Vegas and the technological innovations that deliberately enhance and sustain the 'zone'--the odd, absorbed state for which extreme machine gamblers yearn. An astute and provocative look at addiction and its complex moral, social, and emotional entanglements."--<b>T. M. Luhrmann, Stanford University</b></p><p>"At the heart of Sch�ll's book is the interplay between the players and the machine; between the players and the machine manufacturers; between the players and the math program; and between the players and the 'zone' that the machines help produce. A tour de force that changes the dialogue on gambling addiction."--<b>Henry Lesieur, author of <i>The Chase: Career of the Compulsive Gambler</i></b></p><p>"Sch�ll's clear and dramatic writing style is itself addictive. One is drawn into the ways in which the interactions among the different stakeholders lead to players' experience of being drawn into a 'zone' where they remain until all resources are gone. This is a must-read narrative that points to the many variants of screen addiction possible today.."--<b>Don Ihde, author of <i>Bodies in Technology</i></b></p><p>"This gripping, insightful, and poignant analysis of machine gambling offers a kind of object lesson in the intensified forms of consumption that computer-based technologies enable. An exemplary case of the way in which close, critical investigation of specific sites of capitalism can provide a deeper understanding of both intimate experience and widespread socioeconomic arrangements."--<b>Lucy A. Suchman, author of <i>Human-Machine Reconfigurations</i></b></p><p>"Sch�ll offers a provocative and important study of the imperative some people feel to lose themselves in a machine. The ethnography is rich and deep, shedding original light on the significance of addiction and gambling in American culture. The story told in the book is absolutely riveting."--<b>Emily Martin, author of <i>Bipolar Expeditions</i></b></p><b>Natasha Dow Sch�ll</b> is associate professor in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><h2>Uncle Tom&#39;s cabin, or, Life among the lowly (The World&#39;s best reading)</h2><p>HarperCollins UK Audio Classics presents abridged and unabridged readings of the world&#39;s favorite literary masterpieces.

Labeled racist and condescending by some contemporary critics, it remains a shocking, controversial, and powerful work -- exposing the attitudes of white nineteenth-century society toward "the peculiar institution" and documenting, in heartrending detail, the tragic breakup of black Kentucky families "sold down the river." An immediate international sensation, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> sold 300,000 copies in the first year, was translated into thirty-seven languages, and has never gone out of print: its political impact was immense, its emotional influence immeasurable.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p>
